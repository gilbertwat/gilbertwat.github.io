#README
This is my blog v4.0
Some technology used:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site
- Used [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme for blogs
- Search based on [Lunr](https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search)

P.S.: `master` branch is the generated version. `dev` is the developing version because I want to use the lunr.js plugin and github page disallow it.
