## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳) is a kind of restaurant unique in Hong Kong. They serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals will gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss the core topic I love: "make things people want" in such a local, chill but occassionally heated vibe.

If you are first to a Cha Chaan Teng and doesn't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!  

## About Gilbert

I am a technologist based in Hong Kong. I am helping companies to create customer value through product and engineering and connect them with business result. Specifically, I scale up engineering team in multiple geographies to deliver quality digital products, promote best practices in continuous delivery and nurture kind and truth-telling culture. Individually, I have spotted and resolved engineering bottlenecks in digital products and created new revenue streams.

If you need a full-stack and experienced engineer who is also kind, patience and truth-telling, or you aspire to build a kind, patience and truth-telling team, look no further and [contact me](javascript:location.href='mailto:' + ['g','chachaanteng.co'].join('@')).

Outside work, I am a father, husband, son and brother. I am deeply into cycling and writing in my free time. But as a self-diagnosed ADHD "patient", I am dabbling into a wide range of skills and knowledge, from playing guitar to handless whistling.
