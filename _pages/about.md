## About Gilbert Wat

My service is to scale your business through building valuable software and adopting a set of suitable technology in your value chain. Throughout my career, I have partnered with technologists and a wide range of businesses to build useful software, streamline operations and improve user experience.

Trusted by multiple companies over a decade, I can help you build your product strategically.

If you are facing these challenges:

- A slow delivering software team
- A scattered and ineffective user experience across online and offline touchpoints
- A low or ineffective adoption of key technology, particularly Gen A.I.
- A product in an industry recently disrupted by Gen A.I., such as Education, Legal or Counseling

I can partner with you to tackle them orderly and cost-effectively.

Some highlights of my previous services are:

- In [Preface](https://www.preface.ai) an EdTech company in Hong Kong, I was trusted to leverage or build technology strategically across the 3 diverse business offerings - kid's coding school, corporate technology training and coffee shops. I led a team of ~10 technologists to scale the learning and operation platform from serving a single store to multiple stores in Hong Kong and Macau, from desktop web only to a unified cross platform experience from offline shop to online mobile app experience. Alongside, I have to partner with operations to streamline the operations alongside. I introduced [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to the company within 24 hours of release to establish leadership in the local market on Gen A.I. and ChatGPT training.
- In [GOGOX (previously GOGOVAN) 2246.HK](https://www.gogox.com) the first Hong Kong unicorn startup listed in HKExchange, I have the chance to support business growth and initial public offering project in the technology department. Promoted twice, from a senior software engineer to software delivery manager, I have ultimately led 4 super talented software development teams to build a stable and scalable Platform and Mobile App. We are able to improve upon a 60rps online business critical system, achieving 75% reduction in database cost and app server cost, maintaining 99.9% uptime SLA in 6 operating regions and scoring 25% quarter over quarter decrease in defects throughout my tenure. You can find some of the references in the [application proof of GOGOX IPO](https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2022/0624/sehk22042400132.pdf).
- In [AndyOS](https://www.andyroid.net) a SF-based startup, I developed and bootstrapped a mobile web video ad product and 4X of revenue in 5 months.
- Found [Code4HK](https://code4.hk) in Hong Kong to gather a community of 2000+ civic minded developers in Hong Kong to improve our home city with technology.
- In [MPayme](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mpayme), Contributed as the second Android developer to build the Android clients of a mobile payment app, an Alipay rival.
- Upon graduation, I decided to take a working holiday. In 6 months time, I managed to learn German, found a software development job in Berlin and built an Android app and a mobile web app.

Outside work, I spent my free time dedicated to my family, writing and serving the community.

None of the above would be possible without the support of my family, encouragement from my friends, and guidance from my mentors. And God for His infinite love through all the ups and downs.

## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha Chaan Teng is a space for me to think and share what is challenging me. My inspiration comes from a local style of restaurant in Hong Kong called Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳). Cha Chaan Tengs serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss how to make things people want in such a local, chill but occasionally heated vibe.

If you go to a Cha Chaan Teng and don't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!
