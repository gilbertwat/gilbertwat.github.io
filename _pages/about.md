## About Gilbert Wat

I safeguard and bring multiples to your company investment in technology and product. Trusted by multiple companies over a decade, my services now focus on building a digital product mindset across the company, leading technology team and bringing product experience into your leadership team.

Some highlights so far:

- In [Preface](https://www.preface.ai) a leading EdTech firm in Hong Kong, I inspired new product line and brought new technology in-house. I introduced [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to the company within 24 hours of release. I also build digital user engagement touch-points to nurture and convert clients. Preface has led the tech education and training in Hong Kong with fast, relevant and validated training materials since then.
- In [GOGOX (previously GOGOVAN)](https://www.gogox.com) the first HKExchange listed Hong Kong startup, I supported business growth and initial public offering project in technology. I led 4 software development teams to build a stable and scalable Platform and Mobile App, with 99.9% SLA in 6 operating regions. You can find it in the [application proof of GOGOX IPO](https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2022/0624/sehk22042400132.pdf).
- In [AndyOS](https://www.andyroid.net) a SF-based startup, I developed and bootstrapped a mobile web video ad product and 4X of revenue in 5 months.
- Found [Code4HK](https://code4.hk) in Hong Kong to gather a community of 2000+ civic minded developers in Hong Kong to improve our home city with technology.
- In [MPayme](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mpayme), Contributed as the second Android developer to build the Android clients of a mobile payment app, an Alipay rival.
- Learned German, find a job and built an Android app and a mobile web app in Berlin. All in 6 months time.

Outside work, I spent my free time dedicated to my family, writing and serving the community.

None of the above would be possible without the support of my family, friends, and mentors. I am grateful for their guidance and encouragement. And also God for His grace, mercy and love through all the ups and downs.

## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha Chaan Teng is a space for me to think and share what is challenging me. My inspiration comes from Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳), a kind of restaurant originated from Hong Kong. Cha Chaan Tengs serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss the core topic I love: "make things people want" in such a local, chill but occasionally heated vibe.

If you go to a Cha Chaan Teng and don't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!
