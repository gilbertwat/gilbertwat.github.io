None of the above would be possible without the support of my family, friends, and mentors. I am grateful for their guidance and encouragement. And also God for His grace, mercy and love through all the ups and downs.

## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha Chaan Teng is a space for me to think and share what is challenging me. My inspiration comes from Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳), a kind of restaurant originated from Hong Kong. Cha Chaan Tengs serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss the core topic I love: "make things people want" in such a local, chill but occasionally heated vibe.

If you go to a Cha Chaan Teng and don't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!
