## About Gilbert Wat

My service is to safeguard the investment in technology and product of your company. From SaaS, Ad tech, mobile app to the current Gen AI era, I partnered with the business to innovate and bring multiples to your business. Trusted by multiple companies over a decade, I can help you build strategically.

With a breadth of experience in the full product cycle from lead generation to retention, and a depth of experience in building technology, I can help to build an actual MVP, find product market fit and scales it. As a student of human nature, I can transform your existing team to adopt the current technology advancement and keep your team and business relevant in the Gen AI era.

Some highlights so far:

- In [Preface](https://www.preface.ai) an EdTech company in Hong Kong, my job is to make sure the company leverage or build new technology meaningfully across the business. I lead a team of ~10 technologists to scale the learning and operation platform from serving a single store to multiple stores, from desktop web only to desktop web, mobile web and native app and streamlined operations in the process. I also introduced [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to the company within 24 hours of release to establish leadership in the market on Gen A.I. and ChatGPT training at that moment.
- In [GOGOX (previously GOGOVAN)](https://www.gogox.com) the first HKExchange listed unicorn startup based in Hong Kong, I have the chance to support business growth and initial public offering project in the technology department. Promoted twice, from a senior software engineer to software delivery manager, I have ultimately led 4 super talented software development teams to build a stable and scalable Platform and Mobile App. We are able to improve upon a 60rps online business critical system, achieving 75% reduction in database cost and app server cost, maintaining 99.9% uptime SLA in 6 operating regions and scoring 25% quarter over quarter decrease in defects throughout my tenure. You can find some of the references in the [application proof of GOGOX IPO](https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2022/0624/sehk22042400132.pdf).
- In [AndyOS](https://www.andyroid.net) a SF-based startup, I developed and bootstrapped a mobile web video ad product and 4X of revenue in 5 months.
- Found [Code4HK](https://code4.hk) in Hong Kong to gather a community of 2000+ civic minded developers in Hong Kong to improve our home city with technology.
- In [MPayme](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mpayme), Contributed as the second Android developer to build the Android clients of a mobile payment app, an Alipay rival.
- Upon graduation, I decided to take a working holiday. In 6 months time, I managed to learn German, found a software development job in Berlin and built an Android app and a mobile web app.

Outside work, I spent my free time dedicated to my family, writing and serving the community.

None of the above would be possible without the support of my family, friends, and mentors. I am grateful for their guidance and encouragement. And also God for His grace, mercy and love through all the ups and downs.

## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha Chaan Teng is a space for me to think and share what is challenging me. My inspiration comes from Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳), a kind of restaurant originated from Hong Kong. Cha Chaan Tengs serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss the core topic I love: "make things people want" in such a local, chill but occasionally heated vibe.

If you go to a Cha Chaan Teng and don't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!
