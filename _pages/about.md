## About Cha Chaan Teng

Cha4 Chaan1 Teng1(茶餐廳) is a kind of restaurant originated from Hong Kong. They serve a menu of local comfort food. The locals gather in one of those and chat about anything. I love the vibe of a Cha Chaan Teng and wish to discuss the core topic I love: "make things people want" in such a local, chill but occasionally heated vibe.

If you first go to a Cha Chaan Teng and don't know what to order, the go-to combo is a pineapple bun, an egg tart with a cup of hot milk tea (菠蘿包，蛋撻，熱奶茶). Enjoy!
