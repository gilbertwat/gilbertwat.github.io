I believe that great teams express at least some of the following attributes most of the time:

- shared a common vision and mission.
- shared a clear and frequent communication style.
- be radically candid and kind to each other.
- support and trust each other to do their best.
- be reachable with clear respect of boundaries.
- be good vibe, basically.

And in essence, everyone should always looks for ways to serve our customers and each other.
