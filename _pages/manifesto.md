The world is changing faster. If we are in a team, we cannot afford guessing in our collaboration. Here is a 5 point manifesto I am holding dearly.
4
1. We focus on our mission and goal. And our mission and goal must be helping the underserved people and make a profit.
2. We are all professional and excellent in our duty, understanding the fundamental of your trade is and relentlessly want to improve your quality of work are very important.
3. We are resolving blockers, executing and making progress in a collective and swift fashion.
4. We are respecting each others, and assume we are all helping each other out.
5. We are all human, we are all flawed in some sense. We depend on each other. So be compassionate and kind while we are making progress.

But this list is just only something I can articulate. I believe in the vibe and energy of a leader is key for a leader to craft the optimal environment, so I treat this as one of the documents to invite more candid and effective collaboration with me. There are some other virtues of course, but I prioritize these to be my top 5.
