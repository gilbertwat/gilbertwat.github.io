I believe that great teams express at least some of the following attributes most of the time:

- Common visions and missions.
- Clear and frequent communication style.
- Radically candor and kind to each other.
- Support and trust each other to do their best.
- Always be reachable with clear respect of boundaries.
- Basically good vibe.

And in essence, everyone should always looks for ways to serve our customers and each other.
