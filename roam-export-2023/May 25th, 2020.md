- How do you feel when you wake up?
    - A bit bad as I had an discussion with [[Tom Lui]]
        - Feeling:
            - #angry #disappointed #[[out of control]] #meaningless
        - He came back with a rebuttal on the [[[[GOGOX]] Agile 2.1]] AFTER the RFC
        - I spent 2 hours on meaningless debate with him
        - Action: 
            - Alignment on goals and find the agreed setup can suit his need
            - Alternatively, I can use a more forceful tone as if I don't honor the the process, we are breaking the contract and nothing can get done.
            - I can listen to his problems
            - I need to find out where his insecurity lies.
