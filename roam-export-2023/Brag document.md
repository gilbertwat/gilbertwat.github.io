    - Excerpt
        - Being
            - The leaders who adopted this lens suggested that they have “always thought of themselves as leaders.”
        - Engaging
            - Leaders who used this lens highlighted the successful facilitation of others and activities. They believed their leadership originated when they were compelled to address an urgent need.
        - Performing
            - Do you feel a sense of duty to the organization? Or perhaps you often feel protective of your team, which you might sometimes refer to as “my people”? Leaders who adopted this lens often recounted their leadership as emerging from the achievement of a particular position.
        - Accepting
            - Those who used this lens didn’t think of themselves as leaders until they realized that others were __following__ them. They recalled suddenly noticing that people were coming to them for answers, guidance, and support.
        - Experiment with different origin stories that draw on different past experiences and memories of your leadership. Consider when you saw yourself stepping up during adversity to help others take action, or consider when others looked to you for support, advice, or guidance.
