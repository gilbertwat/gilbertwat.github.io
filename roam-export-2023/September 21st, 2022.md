        - [[[[Preface]] project [[recommender]] in 1 on 1 courses]] Reboot : [[[[Preface]] tag-based courses [[recommender]] system]]
            - Why we need a reboot?
                - A lot of effort in operation for our data collection, making sure data is accurate
                - with [[[[Preface]] [[product]]: Customer Portal]] we can be better in data collection
            - Goal:
                - Expand our scope to recommend the next experience instead of the next knowledge point
                - In [[business]], increase [[LTV]] and [[retention rate]] across cohorts
                - In [[product]], increase [[NPS]]
                - In [[Education]], also increase [[NPS]]
                    - For [[Preface]], the philosophy of [[Education]] is we don't believe in [[standardized test]]s.
                        - But what is the alternative? Could be an item for [[[[Preface]] [[[[2022]] Q4]] [[OKR]]s]]
