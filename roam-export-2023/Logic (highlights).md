    - So what is a valid inference? One, we saw, where the premisses can’t be true without the conclusion also being true. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=783))
    - Characterization Principle (a thing has those properties by which it is characterized). ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1127))
    - Simply by taking these other possibilities into account. Assume that in any situation, every sentence is true but not false, false but not true, both true and false, or neither true nor false. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1223))
    - Following the 17th-century philosopher and logician Leibniz, logicians often call these possible situations, colourfully, possible worlds. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1339))
    - We can write this as The sentence is being used like this when we say things like: ‘You can’t change the past. If something is true of the past, it cannot now fail to be true. There is nothing you can do to make it otherwise: it’s irrevocable.’ ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1370))
    - There is no possible situation in which you have the one, but not the other. That is, in any possible situation, if one is true, so is the other. That is, is true. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1377))
    - They arise when the predicate employed (‘is Black Thunder’, ‘is a child’) is vague, in a certain sense; that is, when its applicability is tolerant with respect to very small changes: if it applies to an object, then a very small change in the object will not alter this fact. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1778))
    - What of validity? An inference is valid if the conclusion holds in every situation where the premisses hold. But what is it now for something to hold in a situation? When it is true enough. ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075KB9C3W&location=1827))
    - An axiom system comprises a bunch of axioms. These are things that we may accept without proof. (The set of axioms may be finite or infinite. But if it is infinite, we need to be able to tell that something is an axiom. Specifically, there should be some algorithm which determines the matter.) A proof in the system is just a sequence of statements, each of which is either an axiom or can be deduced from earlier statements in the sequence. The theorems of the system are things which occur at the ends of proofs. The theorems, then, are the things that can be deduced, ultimately, from the axioms.
