- Estimation problems from [[Chris Tsang]]
    - Data structure is hard to estimate.
        - Data structure from third party API?
            - Example: [[Bullhorn]]
            - Do PoC with `curl` to briefly get a feel of how different is the third party API with our system.
        - New data structure of the system to support new feature?
            - Example: career analytics
            - Do basic system design before making a quotation.
                - Performance issues?
                - Security issues?
                - Is the structure easy to maintain and easy to extend for the business need?
                    - Over-engineering === too generic for business.
                        - Example: Use Foreign exchange API and service for a local service.
                - How basic should it be?
                    - It depends. 😅 Talk to business and development team for calibration.
        - Need to refactor existing data structure
            - Example: Add / subtract API endpoint fields / mongodb field
            - Hardest to charge
            - Do system design before making a quotation.
            - Explain trade-off to stakeholders if not done properly if any.
            - How basic should it be?
                - It depends. 😅 Talk to business and development team for calibration.
        - How do we charge for system design time?
            - In-house setting: aligning expectation with product owner / business analyst.
            - agency (current) setting: No answer 😅. Usually count in man days if too many. But usually it is __free of charge__
            - And it is a competitive advantage as you can keep your cost low with good system design.
            - Given that, it is harder to __sell__ too to less technical clients.
            - But for us, you are fine. 😄
    - At last, trust your instinct!
