    - Follow up on Scheduling discussion with [[Ben Cheng]] [[Anna Yu]] [[Hema Shah]] with [[Anna Yu]] [[Hema Shah]] [[Ben Cheng]]
        - Hard constraints we need to deal with
            - On nomad timeslots
                - Impossible for nomads to commit for schedules far from today (realistically they cannot confirm their schedules yet)
                    - explore non-digital solutions by other teams e.g. full-time nomads
                - Availabilities of nomads specific for students (nomads willing to take the class for only certain students
            - Customer portal should be able to support an internal workflow which is better and more inconvenient for teammates to use than excel spreadsheets or other tools
        - Out of scope 
            - Some specific clients request for nomad profiles before they are willing to pay
                - will not cater to this group yet due to the unknown size of issue / impact
        - Confirm our focus on 1 on 1 and bootcamp
            - Rationales
                - Growth strategy we are using now is through referral and organized
                - High retention is key to increase [[ARR]]
                - More knowledge from the team about these two class types
            - 1 on 1 Scheduling scope should focus on:
                - First scheduling experience (new customers)
                - Optimization of the Nth-session scheduling (recurring customers)
                - Should also cater to customers' preferences including: (A) "Preferred" / Favourite nomad (B) Preference on substitute nomad (if first choice nomad is not available)
            - Bootcamp Scheduling scope:
                - Focus on user-friendly display and purchase of available camps
                - Support rescheduling of whole bootcamp
                - Support rescheduling of individual make-up class (current restrictions quite relaxed, not required under curriculum structure to first complete missed class before the next session)
                - To be discussed in more detail in the next session
