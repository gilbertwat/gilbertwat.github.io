        - We have concluded that the modal style is not applicable to mobile for the bad scrolling UX as per [[Gemmy Wong]] on design critique #[[transformative activity]] session
        - We need to update the visual for the list of course to be more integrated and visually condensed.
        - We need to increase the legibility on the fonts for the list of timeslot.
        - We need to change ">" in list to something else as the convention is "Go to detail"
        - We need to improve the secondary button for invoice overview so that
            - It is more appeal to the Z pattern of reading in human convention
            - It indicates the progress of our users in the form
        - text alignment in the whole design has to be properly set
        - text rhythm and grouping in all pages has to be rational.
        - will be revisiting the design on [[August 24th, 2022]] at 16:30

        - Data Access Principles 
            - General Principles
                - Must have clear records of data access rights
                - Ensure ability to identify and narrow down source of leak 
                - Educate staff on responsibility to safeguard data
                - Principle of Least Privilege
                - SOP for data access request
                    - eg. Must go through team heads, and access allowed only by data team
            - Ideal Future
                - Ticketing system for data access requests
                - Master table of access controls (proposed accessible only by [[Gilbert Wat]], [[Tommie Lo]], [[Alexander Li]])
                - Fine grained access control
                    - Up to row-wise control
                    - Limitations on time wise access
                        - eg. Only possible to view schedules 6 months prior or 6 months in the future
                    - Well documented and defined access scopes by team and role
            - Current Realistic Implementations
                - General principles
                    - Allow line item and schedule access to relevant Ops teams 
                    - Up to column-wise access restrictions for now
        - Operational / Analytical Data 
            - Current Working Definition
                - Operational Data: Data without aggregations and business logic 
                - Analytical Data: Data with aggregations or business logic
                    -  eg. sum of revenue, average nomad review ratings, churn
        - Architecture Changes
            - Use old `Warehouse` codebase as an operational store
            - Increase frequency of Portal backups (multiple times a day or hourly) to facilitate operational data reporting
            - Convert old `Warehouse` code to access Portal backups 
                - Minimal anticipated code change required - should mostly be a query source change
                - Migrate any analytical elements to be used in [[[[Preface]] [[data warehouse]]]] instead
                - Eventual integration of additional validation [greatexpectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) in operational data pipelines
