                - [[f1 score]] is the harmonic mean of precision and recall
                - [[f1 score]] = 2 * ([[precision]] * [[recall]]) / ([[precision]] + [[recall]]), $$2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$

            - [[true positive]] means given the prediction is positive, it actually is positive.
            - [[false positive]] means given the prediction is positive, it actually is negative.
            - [[true negative]] means given the prediction is negative, it actually is negative.
            - [[false negative]] means given the prediction is negative, it actually is positive.
        - https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy
            - [[accuracy]] in [[machine learning]] is the sum of [[true positive]] and [[true negative]] divided by the sum of all [[true positive]], [[true negative]], [[false negative]] and [[false positive]].
        - https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall
            - [[precision]] is [[true positive]] divided by the sum of [[true positive]] and [[false positive]], $$\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
            - [[precision]] the higher the better.
            - [[recall]] is [[true positive]] divided by the sum of [[true positive]] and [[false negative]], $$\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$
            - [[recall]] the hight the better.
            - [[recall]] is always in tension with [[precision]].

        - [[Vesting]] schedule has to be shorter than equity
        - [[smart contract]] needs to be audited
        - [[token allocation]] has to be also reasonable to all stakeholders.
        - [[[[product]]-[[market]] fit]] and utilities is also crucial.
        - [[ideal team]] with relevant experience and backers is also crucial.
