The amounts to be remitted to drivers from the cash payments made by shippers, after netting of the service fees that we charge to drivers, are recorded as payables to drivers. In case we charge a fixed amount to drivers for their use of our platform over a certain period of time, we recognize the fixed amount on a straight-line basis over the usage period.
