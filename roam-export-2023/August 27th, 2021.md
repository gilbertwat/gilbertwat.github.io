- 10:30 - 11:00 Answering whatsapp
    - Received [[Sleekflow.io]] answer for [[VP of [[Engineering]]]]
        - Morning Gilbert. 
- Yesterday I had an extensive discussion with my teams - they have 2 thoughts:
- 1) If we hire a VP of engineering, that person shall have experiences on the role before
- 2) That person also has to be extremely familiar with most stacks we currently use
- For now, I think we will hire more junior to mid levels to execute first.
- But it's really my pleasure to have met you and truly admiring you as a dev
    - #[[🧘🏻‍♂️ Self Awareness]] #Feeling
        - I am aware of the power dynamics of the team
            - [[Henson Tsai [[Sleekflow.io]]]] [[CEO]] of [[Sleekflow.io]] is afraid of his backend engineer
        - I don't think it is the right choice for a backend engineer to dictate the interview process
        - But after all, I am not very keen to join and I am more than happy to be rejected.
        - Still I feel arrogant as I consider myself more experienced. 😈
        - But I will keep the feeling and advice to myself as it is not worth the effort to change their status quo.

- 11:30 - 12:00 Sharing with [[Ravic Poon]] on how to be #[[🧘🏻‍♂️ Self Awareness]] and find out [[the meaning of life]]
    - Welllllll I cannot answer that for you. But I can share some methods:
        - 1. Read good, classic books / novels (Recent read: "The laws of human nature", "The Holy Bible"(yes, the only one holy bible even for non-believer), "Lord of the Rings")
        - 2. Talk to strangers (Interview for job is good way too 🤫)
        - 3. Talk to friends and family (Wifey the best if you can)
        - 4. Write shit down and try to articulate (because if you can describe it you can completely understand it)
        - 5. "Search your feelings" and "watch your actions", my young padawan 😉
