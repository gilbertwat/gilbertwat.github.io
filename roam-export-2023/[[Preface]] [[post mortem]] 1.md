    - Short term
        - Ask teammates to let us know when an event is happening and dry-run all webpagesÂ  with developers. (10 minutes max per events)
        - Refactoring all query with hard coded `title` to a unique ID.
    - Long term
        - Everyone in the company should have the mindset of foundation, starting from tech teammates.
            - Backend code is the most important foundation and we cannot sacrifice the code quality
        - We have to build a coding standard
        - We have to build a set of service level objectives for our system and communicate those to the company.
        - We have to use a set of monitoring and alert tools.
