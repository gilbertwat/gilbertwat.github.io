- How do you feel when you wake up?
    - Last night [[Wifey]] is really really pissed when I propose the possibility to help and she start to list out the execution hurdles
        - I feel unsupported
        - I made a mistake to say, "你唔想幫就唔好幫！😡"
        - She felt very offended. She doesn't mean to be unsupported
        - She has received a cold shoulder from someone so close to her, and this has broken her heart. 💔
