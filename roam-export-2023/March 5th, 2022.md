    - Determined to figure out why [[Theodore]] is fussy in the nights
        - closely monitoring
        - find out 2 signals
            - go super fussy once after some funny burp sound.
            - need to drink a few drop of milk and calm down
            - #hypothesis burping not enough and causing acid reflux
                - #fix
                    - sit on the high chair and let him burp himself before laying him back.
                    - burp longer
- [[Wifey]] Birthday
    - But with a mild fever =(

    - Eat -> [[sleep]] Cycle
    - Eat -> play -> Eat -> [[sleep]] Cycle
