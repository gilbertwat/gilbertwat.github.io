            - Experienced with non-experience is very different
                - Complete newbie
                    - Harder to grasp new concepts

                    - Easier
            - What kind of experience is differ too
                - Say clojure parameter

                    - If I don't understand vector i am stuck
                - Say clojure `->` and `->>` threading macro
                    - If don't understand do notation I am stuck
