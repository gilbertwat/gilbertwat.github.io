            - One of the important parts of the system is that it‚Äôs pretty illiquid. Startups are not like publicly traded stocks; they do not have a price or a public sentiment index that moves up and down with the daily mood. That‚Äôs a really important feature. Startups need to maintain a suspension of disbelief over a long period of time in order to create something out of nothing; nothing kills suspension of disbelief like perception of anything going down. So the solution is for that not to happen. Fundraising and valuation steps occur on a discrete schedule, according to the company‚Äôs narrative. It‚Äôs locked up in the meantime.
            - FOMO rushing in too fast, because that means it can rush out fast.
            - The ‚ÄúRolling Fund‚Äù structure, as productized by Angellist, allows a solo GP to set up a fund that accepts commitments from investors on a quarterly basis, rather than raising the fund commitment all at once and then drawing it progressively through capital calls.
            - Backing an emerging manager is now just as accessible a status symbol as backing a startup.
            - But in reality, it works in the opposite direction: the combination of rolling fund structure plus social status element of joining as an LP, paradoxically, makes it more important to get your commitment in first.
            - the social pressure they unlock puts pressure on you to get in first.
            - status- and social capital- driven social systems to work optimally,¬†they must be opaque.
            - the social returns to angel investing (and now, rolling fund investing) don‚Äôt respond to dilution the same way that financial returns do: follow-on investments don‚Äôt dilute your stake, they augment your cred.
