    - once you get to very high levels of utilization, it takes teams exponentially longer to get anything done. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=483))
    - A successful measure of performance should have two key characteristics. First, it should focus on a global outcome to ensure teams aren’t pitted against each other. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=487))
    - our measure should focus on outcomes not output: ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=490))
    - better organizational culture can indicate higher quality decision-making. In a team with this type of culture, not only is better information available for making decisions, but those decisions are more easily reversed if they turn out to be wrong because the team is more likely to be open and transparent rather than closed and hierarchical. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=756))
    - Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=836))
    - High performers make improvement part of everybody’s daily work. Everyone is responsible. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=840))
    - Comprehensive configuration management. It should be possible to provision our environments and build, test, and deploy our software in ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=847))
    - high- performing teams keep branches short-lived (less than one day’s work) and integrate them into trunk/master frequently. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=852))
    - we should be doing it all the time as an integral part of the development process. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=855))
    - Continuous delivery requires that developers and testers, as well as UX, product, and operations people, collaborate effectively throughout the delivery process. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=862))
    - keeping system and application configuration in version control was more highly correlated with software delivery performance than keeping application code in version control. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=946))
    - It’s interesting to note that having automated tests primarily created and maintained either by QA or an outsourced party is not correlated with IT performance. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=957))
    - Thus, a critical obstacle to implementing continuous delivery is enterprise and application architecture. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=995))
    - was custom software developed by another company ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1030))
    - We can do most of our testing without requiring an integrated environment. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1046))
    - We can and do deploy or release our application independently of other applications/services it depends on. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1047))
    - Make large-scale changes to the design of their system without the permission of somebody outside the team Make large-scale changes to the design of their system without depending on other teams to make changes in their systems or creating significant work for other teams Complete their work without communicating and coordinating with people outside their team Deploy and release their product or service on demand, regardless of other services it depends upon Do most of their testing on demand, without requiring an integrated test environment Perform deployments during normal business hours with negligible downtime ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1053))
    - In teams which scored highly on architectural capabilities, little communication is required between delivery teams to get their work done, and the architecture of the system is designed to enable teams to test, deploy, and change their systems without dependencies on other teams. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1058))
    - Reducing the complexity of the environment Ensuring the necessary skills are in place to manage the technology throughout its lifecycle Increasing purchasing power with vendors Ensuring all technologies are correctly licensed ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1094))
    - When the tools provided actually make life easier for the engineers who use them, they will adopt them of their own free will. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1109))
    - Architects should collaborate closely with their users—the engineers ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1119))
    - OWASP Top 10, ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1139))
    - When building security into software is part of the daily work of developers, and when infosec teams provide tools, training, and support to make it easy for developers to do the right thing, delivery performance gets better. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1172))
    - What are the chances that an external body, not intimately familiar with the internals of a system, can review tens of thousands of lines of code change by potentially hundreds of engineers and accurately determine the impact on a complex production system? ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1260))
    - The fear and anxiety that engineers and technical staff feel when they push code into production can tell us a lot about a team’s software delivery performance. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1339))
    - Symptoms of burnout include feeling exhausted, cynical, or ineffective; little or no sense of accomplishment in your work; and feelings about your work negatively affecting other aspects of your life. In extreme cases, burnout can lead to family issues, severe clinical depression, and even suicide. ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1404))
    - At the heart of Lean management is giving employees the necessary time and resources to improve their own work. This means creating a work environment that supports experimentation, failure, and learning, and allows employees to make decisions that affect their jobs. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1451))
    - Likert-type scale ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1547))
    - Our key hypothesis in asking these questions was that teams implementing continuous delivery practices and taking an experimental approach to product development will build better products, and will also feel more connected to the rest of their organization. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1550))
    - Another key point is that identity includes values alignment with the goals of the team and organization. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1554))
    - This is in contrast to the way many companies still work: requirements are handed down to development teams who must then deliver large stacks of work in batches. In this model, employees feel little control over the products they build and the customer outcomes they create, and little connection to the organizations they work for. This is immensely demotivating for teams and leads to employees feeling emotionally disconnected from their work— and to worse organizational outcomes. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1559))
    - High-performing teams reported having leaders with the strongest behaviors across all dimensions: vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, and personal recognition. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1707))
    - Trust is built on kept promises, open communication, and behaving predictably even in stressful situations. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B9F83WM&location=1766))
