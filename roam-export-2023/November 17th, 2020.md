        - In today’s crowded startup landscape, it’s rarely obvious what will cut 
- through the noise. You’re not just competing with direct competitors for
    - customers, you’re competing with __everyone__ for attention (and all the potential future hires, partnerships and funding rounds that awareness can help drive).
        - Storytelling
            - Iteration
                - The status quo and why it sucks (context)
                - Why this problem is so important (passion)
                - What’s changed about the world — new tech, behavior, regulations— that enables us to finally solve it (timeliness)
                - Why we’re the right team to take it on (credibility)
                - What traction we’re seeing (momentum)
                - What you, the recipient of this message, should do now (call to action)
        - Even more importantly, openly talking about what’s hard 
        - builds trust. As a general rule, you should assume your audience is intelligent and informed.
        - The “relationships” I’m talking about really come down to having 
- somewhat regular and hopefully interesting conversations, including ones
    - where you aren’t trying to convince anyone to write about your company.
        - They tend to be the best barometers for what’s compelling about your 
- story, because they have to keep their readers’ interests and attention 
- spans in mind.
    - Don’t trust that others will take the time to understand the gravity 
- of your news. Figure out how to signal its importance and timeliness, 
- and let that effort take you in new and exciting directions.
