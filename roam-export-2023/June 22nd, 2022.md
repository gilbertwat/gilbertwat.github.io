    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[post mortem]] on [[[[Preface]] blog]] returning 404 on all pages except home page
        - Executive summary
            - After installing a certain plugin, our blog has all pages returning error code 404 but showing the content for 5 days. The incident can be resolved very easily by our new hosting support but it was delayed for 5 days because we are not familiar with wordpress and the daily backup is broken.

            - [[June 8th, 2022]]
                - SEO team discovered they cannot use Elementor to edit and upload new article
                - Tech team found out all pages are returning 404 is the root cause of the problem, unfortunately tech team is unable to resolve the situation
                - Tech team found out that the backup function provided by A2Hosting is broken
                - Contacted A2Hosting support via ticketing system

        - Key metrics
            - [[Time to Recovery]]
                - 5 days
            - Business Impact
                - Greatly affected our SEO rating for our articles
                - SEO team is not able to upload new contents 
        - Root cause analysis
            - Some of the plugins is altering the `.htaccess` file and the default setup for wordpress is overridden. Without the default setup, Wordpress can still functions but all pages will return 404.
                - ```plain text
