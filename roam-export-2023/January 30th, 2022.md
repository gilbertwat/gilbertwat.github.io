    - I want to be more concrete on how I can do the best work in my [[hiring]] in engeineers
    - The more I think about it, you need to offer engineers some combination of these three things to pique their interest:
        - Cool stuff to work on.
        - Smart people to work with.
        - Some degree of repeatability in work environment.
    - If asked to oversimplify what engineers care about, I would pick three things:
        - Technology
        - Intellection
        - Stability
    - Why? Because both of these companies make cool stuff! And making cool stuff is deeply relevant to most engineers.
    - Cool Stuff
        - he number of people who would choose a new job based on “new or different technical challenges”. Over a quarter of our respondents chose this as their primary consideration when seeking a new job. In fact, more respondents chose this over getting a raise; only 20% of respondents would change jobs for money alone. We’ll come back to this data a little later, but for now, I think it’s worth repeating: __interesting technical work is more important to more of our survey respondents than a raise__.
    - Smart People
        - Engineering is knowledge work. You get paid to know stuff much more frequently than you get paid to do stuff. This naturally attracts people who like to think, discuss their thinking, and review that thinking with other people. Engineers are naturally drawn towards discussion and debate - whether out of a desire for a new viewpoint, or a wish to be proven right, I could not say.
    - Certainty
        - **Predictable, repeatable revenue.** Job seeking is a chore; knowing that you won’t have to start a job search over again in 18 months is a great way to convince engineers to come along for the ride. Making money is one of the easiest ways to keep engineers in the building.
        - **Market rate salary compensation.** There was a time that engineers were willing to trade years of their lives for the lottery ticket of stock options. I find that, as more companies try this approach, and it becomes more common, more engineers are becoming literate as to the downsides. More bluntly: more people are starting to understand that stock options are frequently worthless. The certainty of a paycheck that clears every month, regardless of company performance, is highly reassuring to the engineering mind.
        - **Minimal churn.** Nothing makes engineers crankier than whiplashing from one task to another. It diminishes their focus, which diminishes their capability to complete a feature, which diminishes their morale. Shipping stuff is directly related to cool stuff. Nobody is going to think a feature you worked on is cool if it never sees the light of day. That’s just one of the reasons you’ll see a bunch of despondent engineers the day after their project is mothballed by the board. Offering the certainty that their work will see the light of day is a __hugely__ appealing thing to an engineer.
        - **Decisionmaking authority.** Few things make an engineer feel safer than knowing that a buck stops with them. Free rein to make technical decisions is not something that engineers are offered in many companies. They get very used to hearing a steady drumbeat of “Implement! Implement! Implement!” What’s worse: the one chanting this refrain is frequently a Dilbertian, pointy-haired chump who will happily consign you to misery in pursuit of their next bonus check. If you can relinquish some of this authority to an engineer, you will win their trust.
        - **Good management.** Managers: things like trust, shielding your team from churn, and delegating decisionmaking authority downwards, are all signs of good management. Engineers notice. The good ones will ask about it.
    - Engineers can smell this. They also have a natural allergy to being sold to. Wherever you can offer them the transparency to allow them to come to their own conclusions, do so! It shows you have enough respect for them to let them decide the kind of shape your company is in, rather than saying “Just take my word for it”.
    - Here are some ideas for how to do that:
        - If you’re a strictly B2B company, you work when businesses work. That means “9-5” schedules, most major holidays observed, and almost no weekend pager duty. Mention this to your prospects. A sane workplace with defined starts and ends to the workday is very attractive to a certain kind of engineer - the kind that likes to be home for dinner, and read their children bedtime stories, for example.
        - See earlier comment about chatting with the teammates. Transparency on culture and team is huge.
        - Offer flex work. No, seriously - __offer flex work__. This means remote work opportunities, and flexible start/stop times. Every candidate you will speak to has just spent two years productively contributing to a team in a mostly remote capacity. Demanding their hindquarters be in a chair that you specify, at a time and place of your choosing, verges on insulting to the average tech worker these days.
    - A broader point here is that you can afford to be honest about what it is that you do offer to a candidate. Don’t pitch the “hustle and bustle”, “we only hire the best” marketing shpiel you send to your customers. Pitch them the truth: that you want to do good work, sustainably, for as long as you can - ideally with them on your team.

    - How did you #feel this week?
        - I felt very intellectually challenged. It seems I can get a lot achieved in [[Preface]]. On the other side, I felt very overwhelmed as I feel very tired whenever I am home and required a whole 2 hours to recover. I am not sure if this is normal or not. #[[sleep]] quality definitely take a hit as I am always unable to unwind at 10pm. Even on Friday night I am not able to unwind. Finally take some action to start #Meditation again on [[January 29th, 2022]]
