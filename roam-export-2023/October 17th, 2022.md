    - [[Literature Notes]]
        - [[B2B]] [[product]] [[prioritization]]
            - Drop it
                - if it is not aligned with the company or product vision?
            - Bottom of the backlog
                - If it is just a few users
                - If its impact on the company is unknown
                - If it is not validated by data and research
            - Middle of the backlog
                - If there is dependency
                - If the effort is great
                - If we can delay the feature
            - Top of the backlog
                - If it is more important than any of our plans for the next period
                - If the feature is more important than the ones we are working on now?
            - Focus on this now
                - Does it worth the sacrifice to drop everything we're working on now, just to pick this up?
