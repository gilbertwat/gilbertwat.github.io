    - #Verdict
        - I found this book very eye-opening. Although the organization of the book is a bit messy, but the storytelling of this book is very strong. I gained a lot of marketing insights in the once hyper-rational world I am living in.

- Notes
    - Prologue: Challenging Coca-Cola ix
        - Unfortunately, because reductionist logic has proved so reliable in the physical sciences, we now believe it must be applicable everywhere – even in the much messier field of human affairs. The models that dominate all human decision-making today are duly heavy on simplistic logic, and light on magic – a spreadsheet leaves no room for miracles.
        - LOCATION: 141
        - The need to appear scientific in our methodology may prevent us from considering other, less logical and more magical solutions, which can be cheap, fast-acting and effective. The mythical ‘butterfly effect’ does exist, but we don’t spend enough time butterfly hunting.
        - LOCATION: 163
    - Introduction: Cracking the (Human) Code 1
        - There are often two reasons behind people’s behaviour: the ostensibly logical reason, and the real reason.
        - LOCATION: 208
        - My assertion is that large parts of human behaviour are like a cryptic crossword clue: there is always a plausible surface meaning, but there is also a deeper answer hidden beneath the surface.
        - LOCATION: 220
        - There is hence an ever-present temptation to pretend things are more ‘logical’ than they really are.
        - LOCATION: 241
        - Logic is what makes a successful engineer or mathematician, but psycho-logic is what has made us a successful breed of monkey, that has survived and flourished over time. This alternative logic emerges from a parallel operating system within the human mind, which often operates unconsciously, and is far more powerful and pervasive than you realise. Rather like gravity, it is a force that nobody noticed until someone put a name to it.
        - LOCATION: 248
        - but you could make equally strong cases that the Remain campaign in Britain and Hillary Clinton’s failed bid for the American presidency failed because of the clueless, hyper-rational behaviour of overeducated advisors, who threw away huge natural advantages.
        - LOCATION: 285
        - To solve logic-proof problems requires intelligent, logical people to admit the possibility that they might be wrong about something, but these people’s minds are often most resistant to change – perhaps because their status is deeply entwined with their capacity for reason.
        - LOCATION: 311
        - Being slightly bonkers can be a good negotiating strategy: being rational means you are predictable, and being predictable makes you weak. Hillary thinks like an economist, while Donald is a game theorist, and is able to achieve with one tweet what would take Clinton four years of congressional infighting. That’s alchemy; you may hate it, but it works.
        - LOCATION: 344
        - The human mouth allows you to eat, but if your nose is blocked, it also allows you to breathe. In a similar way, it seems illogical to break into a building using the noisiest means possible, until you understand the context in which the offender is operating.
        - LOCATION: 374
        - If you are a technocrat, you’ll generally have achieved your status by explaining things in reverse; the plausible post-rationalisation is the stock-in-trade of the commentariat.
        - LOCATION: 380
        - There are two separate forms of scientific enquiry – the discovery of what works and the explanation and understanding of why it works. These are two entirely different things, and can happen in either order.
        - LOCATION: 385
        - Perhaps a plausible ‘why’ should not be a pre-requisite in deciding a ‘what’, and the things we try should not be confined to those things whose future success we can most easily explain in retrospect. The record of science in some ways casts doubt on a scientific approach to problem solving.
        - LOCATION: 395
        - I’m not joking. I recently had a meeting with a client where I learned that a customer prize draw to win ‘free energy for a year – worth over £1,000’ received 67,000 entries. The subsequent draw, where you could win a cute penguin nightlight (with a value of £15) received over 360,000 entries.
        - LOCATION: 406
        - Business, creativity and the arts are full of successful non-sense. In fact the single greatest strength of free markets is their ability to generate innovative things whose popularity makes no sense. Non-sense includes things that are useful or effective, even though (or perhaps because) they defy conventional logic.
        - LOCATION: 457
        - Presenting such things in a business setting packed with MBA graduates is slightly embarrassing; you start to envy people in IT or tax-planning, who can go into a meeting with rational proposals on a chart or spreadsheet. However, this fixation with sense-making can prove expensive. Imagine you are a company whose product is not selling well. Which of the following proposals would be easier to make in a board meeting called to resolve the problem? a) ‘We should reduce the price’ or b) ‘We should feature more ducks in our advertising’. The first, of course – and yet the second could, in fact, be much more profitable.
        - LOCATION: 466
        - In fact, we derive pleasure from ‘expensive treats’ and also enjoy finding ‘bargains’.

        - By contrast, the mid-range retailer offers far less of an emotional hit; you don’t get a dopamine rush from mid-market purchases.

        - Our very perception of the world is affected by context, which is why the rational attempt to contrive universal, context-free laws for human behaviour may be largely doomed.
        - LOCATION: 540
        - The fatal issue is that logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors. At Ogilvy, I founded a division that employs psychology graduates to look at behavioural change problems through a new lens. Our mantra is ‘Test counterintuitive things, because no one else ever does.’ Why is this necessary?
        - LOCATION: 590
        - There are five main reasons why we have evolved to behave in seemingly illogical ways, and they conveniently all begin with the letter S.* They are: Signalling, Subconscious hacking, Satisficing and Psychophysics.

        - This is because GPS is both incredibly clever but at the same time dogmatic and presumptuous.* It will confidently instruct you to take a particular route, based on a perfect understanding of a very narrow set of data points and a simplistic model of your motivation.
        - LOCATION: 630
        - For instance, whenever I drive to the airport, I often ignore my GPS. This is because what I need when I’m catching a flight is not the fastest average journey, but the one with the lowest variance in journey time – the one with the ‘least-bad worst-case scenario’.
        - LOCATION: 638
        - The reason we don’t always behave in a way which corresponds with conventional ideas of rationality is not because we are silly: it is because we know more than we know we know.
        - LOCATION: 657
        - This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random and not conscious, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer.

        - ‘Human nature hasn’t changed for a million years. It won’t even change in the next million years. Only the superficial things have changed. It is fashionable to talk about the changing man. A communicator must be concerned with the unchanging man – what compulsions drive him, what instincts dominate his every action, even though his language too often camouflages what really motivates him.’
        - LOCATION: 690
        - Human self-deception makes our job difficult for another reason: no one wants to believe in its existence, and it is something which people seem only to accept at a shallow, theoretical level.

        - It isn’t easy to get people to accept the idea of hidden motivations.
        - LOCATION: 707
        - For a business to be truly customer-focused, it needs to ignore what people say. Instead it needs to concentrate on what people feel.
        - LOCATION: 722
        - It’s interesting that, once we leave childhood, we stop asking these apparently childish questions. Try this exercise, which starts with a childish question, but one that might not have been asked before: Why don’t people like being made to stand on overcrowded trains?* I once asked this question in a meeting with a rail company.

        - Plans such as this only emerge when people ask a dumb question with an open mind.
        - LOCATION: 753
        - The reason we do not ask basic questions is because, once our brain provides a logical answer, we stop looking for better ones; with a little alchemy, better answers can be found.

        - LOCATION: 998
        - If you want to solve the problem of unnecessary doctor’s visits or simply to set up a system to prioritise who gets seen by the doctor first, it is vital that you factor in unconscious motivations alongside post-rationalisations.

        - I would rather run a business with no mathematicians than with second-rate mathematicians. Remember that every time you average, add or multiply something, you are losing information.

        - Remember, anyone can easily build a career on a single eccentric talent, if it is cunningly deployed. As I always advise young people, ‘Find one or two things your boss is rubbish at and be quite good at them.’ Complementary talent is far more valuable than conformist talent.

        - One astonishing possible explanation for the function of reason only emerged about ten years ago: the argumentative hypothesis* suggests reason arose in the human brain not to inform our actions and beliefs, but to explain and defend them to others.

    - 4 Subconscious Hacking: Signalling to Ourselves 211
        - I make a very simple point here: the fact that something does not work through a known and logical mechanism should not make us unwilling to adopt it.

        - The intriguing thing about Uber as an innovation was that no one really asked for it before it existed.* Its success lay in a couple of astute psychological hacks: the fact that no money changes hands during a trip is one of the most powerful – it makes using it feel like a service rather than a transaction.

        - Several experts I have talked to in the high-end wine business regard their own field as essentially a placebo market; one of them admitted that he was relatively uninterested in the products he sold and would sneak off and fetch a beer at premium tastings of burgundies costing thousands of pounds a bottle. Another described himself as ‘the eunuch in the whorehouse’ – someone who was valuable because he was immune to the charms of the product he promoted.*

        - The qualities we notice, and the things which often affect us most, are the things that make no sense – at some level, perhaps it is necessary to deviate from standard rationality and do something apparently illogical to attract the attention of the subconscious and create meaning.

    - 5 Satisficing 245
        - However, as soon as we leave school or university, the vast majority of decisions we all have to take are not of that kind at all. Most of the decisions we face have something missing – a vital fact or statistic that is unavailable, or else unknowable at the time we make the decision.

        - In any complex system, an overemphasis on the importance of some metrics will lead to weaknesses developing in other overlooked ones.
        - LOCATION: 3016
        - The primary reason why we have evolved to satisfice in our particularly human way is because we are making decisions in a world of uncertainty, and the rules for making decisions in such times are completely different from those when you have complete and perfect information.
        - LOCATION: 3048
        - In a world of perfect information and infinite calculating power, it might be slightly suboptimal to use these heuristics, or rules of thumb, to make decisions, but in the real world, where we have limited trustworthy data, time and calculating power, the heuristic approach is better than any other alternative.
        - LOCATION: 3082
        - It isn’t always clear which heuristic rules are learned and which are innate, but everyday life would be impossible without them.

        - The evangelists of big data imply that ‘big’ equals ‘good’, yet it by no means follows that more data will lead to decisions that are better or more ethical and fair.
        - LOCATION: 3375
        - The risk of spurious correlations, ephemeral correlations, confounding variables or confirmation bias can lead to more dumb decisions than insightful ones, with the data giving us a confidence in these decisions that is simply not warranted.
        - LOCATION: 3378
        - Another problem with data models is that they may suffer from a psychophysics problem. They match reality with behaviour as though the one maps perfectly onto the other.

        - Perception may map neatly on to behaviour, but reality does not map neatly onto perception.

        - Nature spends a great deal of resources on what might be called ‘perception hacking’ or, in business terminology, marketing.

        - A problem arises when human sciences – politics, economics or medicine, say – believe this universalism to be the hallmark of a science and pursue the same approach; in the human sciences, just as in TV design, what people perceive is sometimes more important than what is objectively true.

        - It seems safer to create an artificial model that allows one logical solution and to claim that the decision was driven by ‘facts’ rather than opinion: remember that what often matters most to those making a decision in business or government is not a successful outcome, but their ability to defend their decision, whatever the outcome may be.
