    - Why are you reading this?
        - I always want to start my own business

    - Excerpts from the article and some scribble
        - Write down what problem you plan to solve, how you'll solve it, and why it's important. Then have your smart friends critique it. Let no valid question go unanswered.
        - Think of a way to make your users have some skin in the game enough to yell at you to make your product better.
        - Learning from users is a practiced skill just like programming. If you don't have experience, make a plan. Start with simple questions, then go deep.
        - During the first 6 mo of my startup, I largely focused on the eradication of risk: Will people want this? Will people pay? Can this make a profit? Can it scale one day? Will the tech work? All in the pursuit of what will kill me? You just need to know thereâ€™s a solution.
        - If you're worried about something that will cause your inevitable demise, use my patented Threshold of Worry (tm):
- 1. Set a quantitative value for the worrisome issue.
- 2. If it's above the value, worry!
- 3. If it's below the value, focus on the next risk & ignore
    - That will often save you time or make you think differently enough to break out of a local maxima.
    - The early team must be sufficiently optimistic & capable of rapid recovery.
    - Momentum is oxygen for a startup. Without momentum, you let fear, uncertainty, and doubt cause your demise.
    - If you have fear, de-risk by talking to users.
- If you have uncertainty, build a prototype to rapidly rebuild your conviction.
- If you have sudden doubt, [[sleep]]. Try again tomorrow
    - The first goal I set for our company was narrow: make 10 happy users use our product. A happy user uses it, pays for it, and organically praises it. Focusing on a few wonderfully happy users is a better recipe for great retention. Then go from 10 â†’ 100 â†’ 1K â†’ 10K â†’ 100K.
    - I was ruthless about ensuring I had as much deep work time as possible. Live somewhere boring. Eliminate meetings. Don't meet investors if you're not raising. Build a rhythm each day that enables the largest chunk of hours to get great work done. Users will notice your pace.
    - Your company culture doesn't need to be set & written in a handbook on day one. I think culture is best formed organically & needs time to bake with a small team. From there, you can discover what works & what breaks. The values of a company need not be preserved, they evolve
