        - [[looking for a co-founder]]
    - [[Excerpts]]
        - there were a few spaces I was interested in, but I didn’t have a specific startup idea so I set my sights on finding a strong co-founder to work with.
        - I knew I didn’t want my search to be random or unfocused, so I honed my process and took my time. I ended up ‘dating’ six different potential co-founders over the course of a year.
        - That’s a huge problem because two of the most common causes of startup failures are not finding product/market fit and co-founder issues.
        - 3 situations
            - Looking for a co-founder and neither of you have an idea yet.
            - Searching for a business or technical co-founder to help you execute on an idea you’ve been working on.
            - Pairing up with someone you already know to find an idea.
        - you can figure out the right space to go after __and__ find the right person to tackle it with in parallel. Don’t compromise on either.
        - It's highly dependent on what they __want__ to do, not just what they've done before — you have to talk about it to find out.”
        - Step 1: Find potential co-founders from your network of entrepreneurial communities.
            - I think you have to get out of your comfort zone and try to make more connections that count,” says Lin. “More tactically, joining entrepreneurial communities and attending events are great ways to broaden your pool. There are even some early-stage investors who help facilitate some of those interactions. The long and the short of it is that you have to be open to opportunity.”
            - The only opportunity that should give you pause is a chance to work with
    - a particularly close friend. “I wouldn't go as far as saying, ‘Don't go
    - fish in that pond,’ but you need to go into it eyes wide open,”
        - Step 2: Identify overlap through initial conversations. Have a few coffee chats to cover some basic topics such as: __What’s your story? What sectors or industries do you have experience in? What areas are you interested in building a startup in?__
            - After finding a potential lead, schedule a few coffee chats or calls to uncover common ground — or a lack thereof.
            - __What kinds of things are you excited to work on? What have you explored recently? Are we interested in the same industries and business models?__
            - __Are we interested in potentially exploring a co-founder relationship together? What would that look like?__ “
        - Step 3: Dive into exploring specific ideas with brainstorming and lightweight prototyping. The goal is to both make progress toward an idea and gain collaboration experience to see what it would be like to work together.
            - “For me, this was the fun part. It’s about getting your hands dirty, 
- digging into a space, figuring out the need, and seeing if a startup 
- idea has potential,” says Lin. “It’s also an opportunity to uncover if 
- you’re __actually__ interested in a 
- certain area. A few times I thought I was passionate about a certain 
- industry, only to discover through hands-on projects that I actually 
- didn’t enjoy it.”
    - It’s not about tinkering aimlessly, though. Lin suggests timeboxing this
    - exploratory period to about two weeks to maximize both learning fast 
- and moving quickly.
    - For B2C, figure out the cheapest possible thing, the crappiest MVP you can get out there within a week or two just to see how things go,”
    - Contrast that with enterprise, which is more about customer discovery. 
- “With enterprise, building often isn’t the hard part. It’s all about 
- selling. You need a shortcut to figure out, ‘Am I making something 
- people want?’
    - How do you currently manage this process?
    - How big of a pain point is it for you, compared to other pain points you have?
    - If you could wave a magic wand and have that problem go away, how would that affect your work or your customers?
    - With the right person, you can push through that, and move onto other areas and experiments.
    - Other times, a business idea had true potential, but we discovered that we had incompatible working styles.”
    - In Lin’s experience, these break-up conversations can be handled several different ways.
    - we had one or two direct conversations about the viability of us working together.
    - Step 4: Fill out the co-founder questionnaire separately and schedule three to four working sessions to go over your respective answers.
        - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x7JYzvqw6Rlt4AZFzXm-XBVtWXDIn7WQFVUBoQfueFQ/edit?usp=sharing
            - **If you’re looking for a co-founder and an idea in parallel**, you might want to use the questionnaire before you get into prototyping.
            - **If you’re searching for a business or technical counterpart** to help you execute on a game plan, you may want to use the questionnaire earlier in the process.
            - **If you’re pairing up with someone you already know**, there’s still tremendous value in running through the questions before taking the leap.
            - **It makes sure you’re aligned on values:** “There are lots of different, perfectly valid ways to build a company, but the co-founders need to be as aligned as possible.
            - **It helps you flex the vulnerability muscle:**
    - “In sharing your answers to the questions, you have a tool that allows 
- you to say: ‘This is what I’m like at my best and my worst. This is how I
    - react when I get stressed. Here’s how I can prevent burnout and achieve
    - my ideal lifestyle. Here are my hopes and dreams
        - **It highlights gaps on the founding team:** “Many of the questions center around your strengths and weaknesses, both professional and personal.
        - **Custom-tailor your own test.** “The questionnaire process is very flexible,
        - **Keep your eyes on your own paper.**
        - **Reconvene to go over your respective answers.** “You could just share your answers over email, but I think you’d miss some context and nuance.
        - “Make a checklist of your non-negotiables, but keep it small — don’t have more than three.”
        - **Table-stakes:** “These are the givens, the absolute basics.
        - **Must-haves:** “I had two: One was personal maturity.
            - **When I'm not in the room am I going to agree with their judgment calls?**
        - **Flex areas:** “For example, 
- some folks aren’t natural-born communicators. Or perhaps you’re looking 
- for a technical co-founder to help build and recruit, but they don’t 
- have a ton of experience as a manager.
    - If they exhibit humility, a willingness to learn and self-awareness 
- around these areas of growth, you can still make a great team.
    - Behaviorial test
        - **What’s the worst interpersonal conflict you’ve dealt with? How did you handle it?**
    - “I think this question is particularly important to look out for. I 
- want to have the tools I need to navigate inevitable conflicts 
- successfully with my co-founder
    - **How many hours/week are you willing to work? What sounds ideal and what sounds like hell?**
    - Roles
        - **How do you see your role changing after we reach product/market fit? What about once we start to scale?**
        - **Areas of Responsibility Exercise**:
    - “I found this exercise to be so useful. There are a lot of areas that 
- neither of you have experience in, so adding the dimension of who has 
- high passion for it can be really helpful
    - Rank yourself in the areas below (both as an individual contributor and as a leader) on a scale of 1-10.
        - Sales
        - Marketing
        - Product Strategy
        - Design
        - Engineering
        - Operations
        - Fundraising
        - Leadership
        - Company building
        - Recruiting
        - Legal
        - Domain Specific Skills
    - **Part II. Corporate Structure and Funding**
        - You don’t have to have perfect answers here, but make sure you think 
- about it proactively and discuss it intentionally — too often it’s 
- something that evolves haphazardly, which is a recipe for hurt feelings 
- later on.
    - **How much money should we raise?** **In the range of “bootstrapped small business” to “go big or go home,” where do you want this startup to go?**
    - **How should founder equity be set? What’s your philosophy on the employee equity pool?**
        - Sometimes a highly unequal arrangement makes sense when there’s a mismatch in experience between the co-founders.
    - **What do we do if we find product/market fit, yet none of the founders are excited about that product?**
    - **Part III. Personal Motivation**
        - **Why do you want to start a company — in general, and in particular right now?**
        - **What makes you gritty?**
    - **Part V. Team Culture**
    - **Part VI. Co-Founder Relationship**
        - **In case this becomes part of our 
- partnership’s evolution, how would you go about handling a startup 
- divorce? How would you think about bringing on a third (or N+1) 
- cofounder?**
    - Step 5: Commit to working together or part ways. Know when to pull the trigger — and when to stop and start anew with someone else.
        - Of course, this was after we spent four months working together. We’d 
- already uncovered a really interesting market opportunity. All of this 
- put together made me feel ready to dive in.”
    - Now in the thick of their company-building journey, Lin and her 
- co-founder are focused on getting their idea off the ground. But they 
- still plan on making the co-founder relationship a true priority.
    - But I think you know that you have something special on your hands when 
- you have an easy chemistry and you’re both willing to put in the 
- commitment required for the long haul.
