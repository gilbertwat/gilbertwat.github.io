                        - Belief
                            - Customer trust is hard to win and easy to lose. When you let customers make your business what it is, then they will be loyal to you—right up to the second that someone else offers them better service. We know that customers are perceptive and smart. We take as an article of faith that customers will notice when we work hard to do the right thing, and that by doing so again and again, we will earn trust. You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well—delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they’re unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading, and automating their homes.

                    - Empower individuals to take daily [value attempts](https://iism.org/post/glossary-value-attempt-74)
                    - Use light weight value attempts and amplified learning
                    - Drive to value, not to date
                    - Seed your creative teams with research, promotion, and analysis skills
                    - Avoid forcing individuals into the same ways of thinking about a problem
                    - Encourage your creative staff to move fast and break things
                    - Embrace failure, celebrate learning
                    - Personally, fail more often. If you’re not failing, I promise you, you aren’t learning, and you’re therefore likely not leading your industry either, seriously.
