        - {{[[DONE]]}} Gather enough metrics from all levels and departments to construct an actionable company dashboard
        - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Leadership]] team needs to know 
            - [[Edwin Chiu]] has a OKR of Revenue
                - but there is no visibility of revenue to him
                - The definition of revenue is murky at best
                - need another definition for cash in and not ultilization
        - cannot attribute which channel can convert
            - Internal portal has a field but not very useful
        - Sleekflow
            - 5-10 columns to report the data required to complete the sales
        - Sales co owned
            - CAC by channels
            - CAC by products
        - Sales to close deals
        - Impressions (easy to automate)
        - Number of leads generated
        - CPL by channels
        - CPL by products
        - Conversions of unique students
        - Tried https://supermetrics.com/product/api
            - how to categorize Ads is hard
        - categorization of lead by product is a human judgement based on conversation, channel in ...etc.
    - Conversion
    - Hubspot + Sleekflow is the main tools
    - weekly metric will spend Edwin half a day each week
    - data tracking / collection is the most problematic
    - GA4 ecommerce is not very useful
        - User journey cannot be tracked as there is some engineering gap
    - CAC by channel is the worst
