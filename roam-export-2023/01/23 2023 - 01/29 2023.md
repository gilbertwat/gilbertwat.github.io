- What did I learn in this week?
    - The business model of original Uber or GOGOVAN or foodpanda is bad because the core engagement or satisfaction delivery is not controlled by the app. But users will ALWAYS misattribute the quality of the product to the quality of the food / ride / van.

    - Done a presentation of [[Lunch and learn on ChatGPT]]
    - Got [[[[Preface]] [[strategy]]: product metrics]] into the leadership team
