    - I kinda remove all distractions and practicing [[stoic philosophy]]. 
    - I tried to remove all üéØ Focus and search my soul for [[üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Self Awareness]]. So far I care about ((NYwOUV3mG)), mostly my [[Wifey]] and ((P4PLsikLN)). But my care is not very strong. I need some more [[me time]] to recharge.
    - I actually care deeply about if I am able to live freely, in an environment of Freedom. But at the same time I have [[GOGOX]] that I either inherited or taken willingly.
