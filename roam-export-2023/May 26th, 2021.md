- [[ðŸŽ¯ Major [[decision]]]]: To bite the bullet and jump into the new [[[[GOGOX]] Project Flywheel]]
    - Reasons:
        - To try my hand on a new project that can potentially help the company escape the deathly spiral.
        - To get my hands dirty on a new project.
    - Trade-off:
        - No longer in the position with the most teammates reporting to me.
