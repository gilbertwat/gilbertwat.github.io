    - By mapping out the user’s stories, the design retains its narrative structure yet can still be deconstructed for effective implementation. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=63))
    - Good teams understand the need for speed and how rapid iteration is the key to innovation, and they understand this speed comes from the right techniques and not forced labor. Bad teams complain they are slow because their colleagues are not working hard enough. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=108))
    - Good teams make high-integrity commitments after they’ve evaluated the request and ensured they have a viable solution that will actually work for the customer and the business. Bad teams complain about being a sales-driven company. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=110))
    - Talk, sketch, write, use sticky notes and cards, and then photograph your results. Even better, shoot a short video of you talking through what’s on the board. You’ll remember lots of details in a remarkable depth that you could never possibly document. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=373))
    - Your company can’t get what it wants unless your customers and users get something they want. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=427))
    - The flow continues by choosing the people to focus on, the problems to solve, and the ideas to turn into working software. And from there—if the customers buy, and the users use it, and people are happy—eventually the business that sponsored this development will see the benefit it’s looking for. That’ll be reflected in things like increased revenue, lower operational costs, happier customers, or expanded market share.

        - **Note**: The value chain is long
    - At the end of the day, your job is to minimize output, and maximize outcome and impact. The trick is that you’ve got to pay close attention to the people whose problems you’re trying to solve. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=444))
    - It was at that moment that I learned that the word requirements actually means shut up. For a great many people, that’s exactly what requirements do. They stop conversations about people and the problems we’re solving. The truth is, if you build a fraction of what’s required you can still make people very happy.[3] Remember: at the end of the day, your job isn’t to get the requirements right—your job is to change the world.

    - Intelligently, he changed his strategy to focus on learning—to focus on validating all those assumptions the company had made in its first MVP release. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=978))
    - What is the big idea? ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=1001))
    - Who are the customers? Who are the companies we think would buy the product? ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=1001))
    - Who are the users? Who are the types of people inside those companies we think would use the product, and what would they be using it for? Why would they want it? What problems would it solve for customers and users that they couldn’t solve today? What benefit would they get from buying and using it? Why are we building it? If we build this product and it’s successful, how does that help us? ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NF07FHS&location=1002))
