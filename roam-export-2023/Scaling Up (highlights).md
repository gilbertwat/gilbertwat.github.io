    - First, what you’re planning to do really matters to enough customers; and second, it differentiates you from your competition. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=243))
    - Set a handful of Priorities (the fewer the better); gather quantitative and qualitative Data daily and review weekly to guide decisions; and establish an effective daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual meeting Rhythm to keep everyone in the loop. Those who pulse faster, grow faster. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=245))
    - much attention to how every decision affects cash flow as you would to revenue and profitability. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=248))
    - Are the stakeholders (employees, customers, shareholders) happy and engaged in the business; and would you “rehire” all of them? ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=316))
    - Our personal and professional lives are intertwined — and best if aligned. This tool looks at four key decisions — Relationships, Achievements, Rituals, and Wealth — which mirror the four key decisions for the business: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=325))
    - You’re experiencing the growth paradox: the belief that as you scale the company — and increase your dream team, prospects, and resources — things should get easier, but they don’t. Things actually get harder and more complicated. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=613))
    - Leadership: the inability to staff/grow enough leaders throughout the organization who have the capabilities to delegate and predict •   Scalable infrastructure: the lack of systems and structures (physical and organizational) to handle the complexities in communication and decisions that come with growth •   Marketing: the failure to scaleup an effective marketing function to both attract new relationships ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=628))
    - This is why Rudy spent three months on the road visiting Perceptionist’s customers, discovering a new business model that tripled the value of his investment. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=681))
    - To get to 10 employees, founders must delegate activities in which they are weak. To get to 50 employees, they have to delegate functions in which they are strong! In many cases, the strength of the top leader becomes the weakness of the organization. For example, if the founder is the CEO and the main sales driver, either everyone ignores the big picture or revenue stalls. The leader needs to delegate one of these two functions if the company is to continue to scale up. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=689))
    - From 50 employees on up, the senior leaders must develop additional leaders throughout the organization who share the same values, passion, and knowledge of the business.

([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=693))
    - Successful delegation requires four components, assuming you have delegated a job to the right person or team: 1.   Pinpoint what the person or team needs to accomplish (Priorities — One-Page Strategic Plan). 2.   Create a measurement system for monitoring progress (Data — qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators). 3.   Provide feedback to the team or person (Meeting Rhythm). 4.   Give appropriately timed recognition and reward (because we’re dealing with people, not machines). ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=698))
    - Repetition encompasses consistency. Finish what you start. Mean what you say. And don’t say one thing and do something else. Consistency is an important aspect of repetition. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=721))
    - Core Values: the handful of rules defining the culture, which are reinforced through your People (HR) systems on a daily basis 2.   Core Purpose: the top leader’s regular stump speech to keep everyone’s heart engaged in the business 3.   Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG®): the 10- to 25-year goal that provides constant context for all of the decisions made throughout the organization 4.   Priorities/Themes: a handful of three- to five-year, one-year, and quarterly priorities, which require repeated review on a daily and weekly basis to keep them top-of-mind ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=724))

The EBIT/Revenue ratio is a measure of P&L efficiency (i.e., how much profit is produced from every $1 of revenue). This translates into a measure of how efficiently you’re operating and tells you if you are squeezing the most profit from every dollar of revenue. ([Location 4590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=4590))
    - Most businesses that we see do not give regular consideration to their balance sheets.

([Location 4601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=4601))
    - To keep it simple, however, midsize businesses should target at minimum a 30% return on net assets. ([Location 4605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=4605))
    - As a business owner, you should also consider that equity is the most expensive source of funding and that it is usually cheaper to source debt financing, ([Location 4609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00O5RR7QO&location=4609))
