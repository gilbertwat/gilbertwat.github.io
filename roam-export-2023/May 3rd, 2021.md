- Start the day **strong**!
- [[Ergon]] 1 min prep to team for [[May 5th, 2021]]
    - I heard there was a fallout in the last sync up meeting, I think everyone has a bit of emotion in this project.
        - This is good! It means everyone cares.
            - I have asked [[Chris Tsang]], [[Kingson Kwan]], [[Tony Fung]] and [[Kwong Kin Ming (KM)]] for their personal input. 
                - They are super insightful and I believe we can sort this out together.
            - Of course everyone cares different things differently.
                - But I think everyone should be able to care about the same thing.
                    - 1. Project should be completed ASAP.
                    - 2. with the app functional to the end users. (Give up performant and leng jai for now)
                    - 3. with everyone spending the least time and energy to do so.
                - Does everybody agree?
                    - If everyone agrees, I would like everyone to keep these goals in mind.
                - Practically, I would like to suggest to refresh following house rules:
                    - Rules:
                        - The app requirement will be frozen from now. No "new requirements" will be added. Only clarification and bugs will be added to the gitlab issues. Unless it is not **functional** to the end users.
                        - Until project launch, everyone should do a quick update daily morning on whatsapp channels about
                            - What have you accomplished yesterday about this project?
                            - What have you planned to do today?
                        - If there is any blocker(unclear requirements, missing edge cases founded...etc.), just reach out to everyone (even via phone is ok folks) and resolve it on the spot. ðŸ˜‰
                    - These rules are for us to keep blockers as short as possible.
                    - Does everyone agree?
                - Individually, I think we need to get it clear, I am sure everyone is aware of but not crystal clear:
                    - [[Kingson Kwan]] will be responsible for keeping the requirement as stable and clear as possible.
                        - Or else, dev team has to reschedule release date again.
                    - [[Kwong Kin Ming (KM)]] will be responsible for keeping the requirements as clear and complete as possible in the form of test cases / acceptance criteria / flow charts / whatever formats dev team needs.
                        - Or else, dev team will have a lot of blockers from requirements and project release date will need to reschedule again.
                    - [[Chris Tsang]] will be responsible for keeping the implementation in his ticket as complete and robust as possible.
                        - Or else, [[Tony Fung]]'s frontend will be blocked.
                        - Or else, we need to spend time to test again and again.
                    - [[Tony Fung]] will be responsible for keeping the implemenation in his ticket as complete and robust as possible.
                        - Or else, the project cannot be completed.
                        - Or else, we need to spend time to test again and again.
                    - Everyone will be responsible for
                        - For keeping voice out his concerns as soon as possible
                        - Resolve issues from teammates as soon as possible (15 minutes in [[GOGOX]] but I think we are mature enough)
    - All in all, I think everyone cares and mature enough to focus on the project goal.
        - But I think everyone should be able to care about the same thing.
            - 1. Project should be completed ASAP.
            - 2. with the app functional to the end users. (Give up performant and leng jai for now)
            - 3. with everyone spending the least time and energy to do so.
        - I believe play our part well and keep other informed, we can ship [[[[Ergon]] app]] on our set release date.
    - Let's move on to the tickets.
- #NoteToSelf Founders suppose to be 1000% [[focus]] on their companies. Why spend time gossiping other companies news?
- #NoteToSelf Never talk to people who engage to win arguments instead of to understand or to solve problems.
- #NoteToSelf Clarity has a different form for everyone.
- #NoteToSelf The world is complex, it is OK to have no opinion on things doesn't matters to you.
