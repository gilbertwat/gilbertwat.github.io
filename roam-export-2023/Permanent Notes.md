- [[true positive]] means given the prediction is positive, it actually is positive.
- [[false positive]] means given the prediction is positive, it actually is negative.
- [[true negative]] means given the prediction is negative, it actually is negative.
- [[false negative]] means given the prediction is negative, it actually is positive.
- [[precision]] is [[true positive]] divided by the sum of [[true positive]] and [[false positive]], $$\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
- [[precision]] the higher the better.
- [[recall]] is [[true positive]] divided by the sum of [[true positive]] and [[false negative]], $$\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$
- [[recall]] the hight the better.
- [[recall]] is always in tension with [[precision]].
- [[accuracy]] in [[machine learning]] is the sum of [[true positive]] and [[true negative]] divided by the sum of all [[true positive]], [[true negative]], [[false negative]] and [[false positive]].
- [[f1 score]] is the harmonic mean of precision and recall
- [[f1 score]] = 2 * ([[precision]] * [[recall]]) / ([[precision]] + [[recall]]), $$2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$
- One of the [[symptoms of [[toxic [[culture]]]]]] is asking who is responsible for what.

- [[EBIT]] =  [[EBITDA]] - [[depreciation]] - [[amortization]]
- [[net profit]] =[[EBIT]] - [[interest]] - [[tax]]

- [[Trie]] is used to retrieve a [[string]] value by [[depth-first]] traversal.
- Global [[Learning style]] in [[Felder-Silverman Model]] means the person is learning by topic and jump from concepts to concepts.
- Sequential [[Learning style]] in [[Felder-Silverman Model]] means the person is learning by sequence.
