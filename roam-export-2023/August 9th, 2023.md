    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Resolved financial issue with [[Charlie Mak]] [[Inspect Element]] [[Vincent So]]
        - It has been a very painful conversation. #learning
            - The problem is that I am in a loss of reputation in a few ways.
                - The reputation of [[Gilbert Wat]] inside [[Preface]] as I slipped on basic admin work such as summiting payment request and budget request.
                - The reputation of [[Gilbert Wat]] outside [[Preface]] as money is the fundamental of trust and commerce
                - The reputation of [[Preface]] as we wronged twice to [[Inspect Element]]
            - I created a lose-lose situation because we de-prioritized some very major stuff.
