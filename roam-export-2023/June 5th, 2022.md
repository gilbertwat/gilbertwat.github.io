        - To cultivate good [[judgement]], a leader needs to hone 5 areas of skills
            - Learning
                - To turn knowledge into understanding, [[listen]]ing attentively is a must to pick up this we ignore or miss
                    - [[Reflection]]: Maybe it is because as we age, we tended to use our experience and forget that context matters, if not the most for solving a problem.
                - A tactic of active [[listen]]ing is to ask sufficiently open-ended questions
                - A tactic of active [[listen]]ing is to look for non-verbal cues when listening

            - Trust
                - Cultivate sources of trusted advice from people who can tell you what you need to know rather than what you want to hear
                - One tactic is to ask people about their career failure and setback.
            - Experience
                - Experience can allow the leaders to focus their energy and resources.
                - Ask "Does she ask you questions or she just making a pitch?"
                - Ask How did he get where he is and whom does he listen to?
                - Ask What kind of training has she done?
                - Ask Does she like to challenge his own assumptions?
                - One of the pitfall of experience is the experience is not applicable to the current situation.
            - Detachment
                - Identify

                - Good [[judgement]] requires [[Reflection]] before action.
                - Press for clarification on poorly presented information, and challenge your people if you think important facts are missing. 
                - Question their weighting of the variables on which their arguments depend. If timing appears to be a key consideration, determine that it's legitimate. 
                - Factor in the risks associated with novel solutions-stress and overconfidence-and look for opportunities to mitigate them through piloting. 
                - Use modeling, triangulation, and the opportunities afforded by artificial intelligence. 
                - Follow King Solomon (a popular nominee in answer to my question “Who do you think has/had good judgment?”) and dig out people's stakes in the final decision. 
                    - What are the personal consequences to them (and to you) if their solution works or fails? 
                - Consult those you trust.
                - Be bold and consider good judgement
            - Delivery
                - In assessing a proposal, make sure that the experience of the people recommending the investment closely matches its context. 
                - If they point to their prior work, ask them to explain why that work is relevant to the current situation. 
                - Get the advocates to question their assumptions by engaging in “premortem” discussions, in which participants try to surface what might cause a proposal to fail. RWE now does this as part of its project
evaluation process.
