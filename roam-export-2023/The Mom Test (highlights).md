    - It’s a casual approach to conversation, based on chipping away the formality and awkwardness of talking to people and taking full responsibility for asking good questions. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=43))
    - Doing it wrong is worse than doing nothing at all. When you know you’re clueless, you tend to be careful. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=96))
    - The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=130))
    - After just one conversation (with our mom, of all people), we have a higher fidelity vision. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=135))
    - Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=150))
    - Rule of thumb: People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve those problems. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=189))
    - "Why do you bother?" Good question. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=190))
    - Rule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=196))

    - "Talk me through the last time that happened." Good question. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=204))
    - Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=213))
    - "What else have you tried?" Good question. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=215))
    - Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=228))
    - Rule of thumb: People stop lying when you ask them for money. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=236))
    - "How are you dealing with it now?" Good question. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=237))
    - "Where does the money come from?" Good question. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=244))
    - It leads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=246))
    - "Who else should I talk to?" Good question. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=249))
    - Rule of thumb: People want to help you. Give them an excuse to do so. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=259))
    - Deciding what to build is your job. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=263))
    - The questions to ask are about your customers’ lives: their problems, cares, constraints, and goals. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=263))
    - Compliments Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future) Ideas ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=274))
    - You: (Back at the office) “That meeting went really well. They said they loved it! In fact, everybody loves it. I really think we’ve finally found our big idea. We’ve found something people want.” It’s margarita time! Your Team: (6 months later) “Why do we have zero customers? I thought you said everybody loved it?” Wasn’t this your job? You: “I don’t know, I talked to like a thousand people. I must have missed one of their buying criteria. Don’t worry, I’ll go talk to them some more and we’ll get it next time.” Doooooomed. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=297))
    - Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and worthless. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=344))
    - Generic claims (“I usually”, “I always”, “I never”) Future-tense promises (“I would”, “I will”) Hypothetical maybes (“I might”, “I could”) ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=346))
    - “I would definitely buy that.” ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=350))
    - When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which led to it. You do that by digging around the question to find the root cause. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=465))
    - To deal with The Pathos Problem, keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=494))
    - You can’t learn anything useful unless you’re willing to spend a few minutes shutting up (even if you have something really smart to say). ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=518))
    - In each case, the customer was about to give you a privileged glimpse into their mental model of the world. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=523))
    - Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=536))
    - It can bring us to the unsettling realisation that our beloved idea is fundamentally flawed. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=546))
    - Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=556))
    - The premature zoom is a real problem because it leads to data which seems like validation, but is actually worthless. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=621))
    - Sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don’t actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking questions. We ignore the elephant in the room. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=686))
    - Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s probably too formal. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=812))
    - When you fail to push for advancement, you end up with zombie leads: potential customers (or investors) who keep taking meetings and saying nice things, but who never seem to cut a check. It’s like your startup has been friend-zoned. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=853))
    - A pipeline of zombie leads Product meetings that end with a compliment Product meetings that end with no clear next steps Meetings which “went well” They haven’t given up anything of value ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=860))
    - You know how to deal with compliments by now: deflect, ignore, and get back to business. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=877))
    - The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=886))
    - Rule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance to reject you. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=963))
    - Have the problem Know they have the problem Have the budget to solve the problem Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=980))
    - The goal of cold conversations is to stop having them. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1001))
    - Rule of thumb: If it’s a topic you both care about, find an excuse to talk about it. Your idea never needs to enter the equation and you’ll both enjoy the chat. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1030))
    - I’m skeptical of the quantitative value of landing page metrics. But they are certainly a great way to collect emails of qualified leads for you to reach out to and strike up a conversation with. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1042))
    - Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1125))
    - People like to help entrepreneurs. But they also hate wasting their time. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1144))
    - It’s worth noting that this is how I set up meetings from warm intros. Warm intros mean the person wants to give you the benefit of the doubt, but is still terrified you’re going to waste their time with a vague, chit-chatty meeting. ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1160))
    - More subtly, calls damage the delicate power dynamic of these conversations. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1169))
    - With that mindset switch, you’ll know why you’re there. And instead of it being a customer-learning-but-I-really-want-to-do-sales meeting, it becomes a let-me-find-out-if-you-are-a-good-advisor-by-asking-questions meeting. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1182))
    - It’s not about “how many” meetings. It’s about having enough for you to really understand your customers. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1199))
    - But they didn’t start there. If you start too generic, everything is watered down. Your marketing message is generic. You suffer feature creep. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1212))
    - The confused founders we met at the beginning of this section were having the same experience, but for “sales organisations” instead of “students”. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1263))
    - On a personal note, I really feel that third factor is important; it’s worth choosing customers you admire and enjoy being around. This stuff is hard work and can be a real grind if you’re cynical about the people or the industry you’re trying to understand and serve. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1298))
    - Don’t fall into the trap of only talking to the most senior or important people you can find. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1313))
    - When all the customer learning is stuck in someone’s head instead of being disseminated to the rest of the team, you’ve got a learning bottleneck. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1327))
    - Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, you shouldn’t bother having the conversation. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1358))
    - You can't outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. There are exceptional team dynamics where it works, but generally speaking, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1382))
    - When possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so you know it’s verbatim. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1390))
    - In either case, add symbols to your notes as context and shorthand. I use about a dozen main symbols and make up more in the field as needed. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1393))
    - When I first started, I would make audio recordings, but that suffered from the same problem as notebooks: I’d end up with a ton of content and no real way to sort it or find the bit I wanted. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1434))
    - The time scales of the process are important. The point is to make your business move faster, not slower. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1472))
    - It happens. It’s okay. Review with your team, don’t beat yourself up (or your cofounders) over mistakes. Work on getting better as a team. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1486))
    - Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1512))
    - Deflect compliments Anchor fluff Dig beneath opinions, ideas, requests, and emotions ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1515))
    - Facts — concrete, specific facts about what they do and why they do it (as opposed to the bad data of compliments, fluff, and opinions) Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as meaningful amounts of time, reputation risk, or money Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1535))
