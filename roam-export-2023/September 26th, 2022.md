    - Sort out the relationship between the relationship between different marketing site for [[[[Preface]] membership scheme]] with [[Mandy Ng]] and [[Carmen Yeung]]
        - In the meeting, we shared the functionality of buy link([app.preface.ai/pudchase/annual-pass](http://app.preface.ai/pudchase/annual-pass)), wix site([annualpass.preface.ai](http://annualpass.preface.ai/))and the potential new site on growth team using Shopify. 
        - Tech team recommended to send the conversion to buy link for all marketing websites. 
            - It is more convenient for every teams to follow through our customer onboarding. 
        - This poses a challenge in tracking of retargeting, conversion and drop in funnel as buy link currently has no tracking. 
            - Tech team suggest to place google tag in the URLs so that tech team can at least pick it up in the server log. 
            - Tech team will add essential tracking on customer portal whenever priority and effort aligned with our budget.
        - One challenge for added hurdle to convert is we may already collect some information(email and/or phone #) from our leads on the acquisition journey, and we cannot feed in those data back to our portal easily. 
            - extra possibility of churn. 
            - Tech team will investigate more on this as their can be multiple ways to solve this problem. 
            - In the meantime [[Mandy Ng]] will see if there is any solution from her side first.

    - Sort out the next step for [[[[Preface]] nomad payment enhancement]] with [[Anna Yu]] [[Ben Cheng]] and [[Moses Ngan]]
        - Goal
            - Reduce legal risk of our liability incurred from nomads breaching the law during our sessions.
            - Increase supply of nomads and their quality by aligning their incentives to teach more sessions.
            - Reduce operation cost from training team and people team when handling payment.
        - Estimating **__3-4 weeks of development__
        - Dependencies
            - Including all nomad tasks** **in our portal (including all B2B events, content curation, TA ...etc.) is a must in our SOPs. A definite price is a must but a set price for each event type is even better.
            - Portal can handle edge cases for all nomad scheduling. For example, no-show, late to sessions ...etc. This is aligned with our customer portal MVP scope.
            - Portal can mark / handle edge cases for all nomad tasks. For example, late in task delivery...etc.
        - Major complexity
            - StatementItem partial payment.
        - Suggestion
            - Revisit in [[[[2023]] Q1]]
