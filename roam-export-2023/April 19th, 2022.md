        - ## Poison pills
        - Here are some things you could do\[1\]:
        - 1.  Buy 51% of the stock of a public company in the open market over time, just buying whenever anyone sells, looking for any blocks of stock that come loose, paying the market price for each trade, etc. To put numbers on it, let’s say you start buying at around $40 per share and finish at around $50 per share. (Your buying, and the legally required disclosure of your ownership, will push up the price.) Once you have 51%, you take control, vote out the board, vote in your buddies, elect a new chief executive officer and run the company however you want.
        - 2.  Buy 51% of the stock of a public company in a tender offer. A tender offer is just a big coordinated public offer to buy stock, open to all shareholders at the same price. You announce to all shareholders, “I want to buy 51% of this company and I’ll pay $50 per share in cash, but I won’t buy more than 51%.” More than 51% tender, you prorate the offer (not buying all the shares that are tendered), you get to exactly 51%, paying $50 per share. You proceed as above, taking control of the board etc.
        - 3.  You acquire 51% of the company and take control of the board, as in either Thing 1 or Thing 2. Then you propose a merger at $30 per share. The new board — your buddies — agrees, and submits it to a shareholder vote. You vote your 51% of the shares in favor, and the merger happens; you acquire the remaining 49% of the stock at $30 per share. The holders of that 49% — who did not sell to you at $50 in the first step — are forced to sell to you at $30 in the second step. (That’s how mergers work: When the merger happens, the stock is automatically converted into whatever the merger consideration is, here $30 in cash.)
        - 4.  Same as Thing 1, but instead of buying 51% you buy, I don’t know, 30%. At 30% you just need to convince a few other shareholders to vote with you to kick out the board, etc. As the biggest shareholder, you might have effective control even without a majority.
        - 5.  Offer to buy 100% of the stock of the company in a tender offer. Announce to all shareholders, “I want to buy 100% of this company and I’ll pay $50 per share in cash. But let me warn you. If I get above 51%, but not to 100%, I will definitely do a second-step merger (as in Thing 3), and I’ll do it at $30 per share. So if you want $50, you better tender now, because if you don’t you’re getting $30.” Shareholders might think that $50 is too low, and might not want to tender. But they can’t be sure that 51% of the stock _won’t_ tender, and they don’t want to be left out. So they tender for $50 to avoid getting stuck with $30. (This is called a “[two-tier tender offer](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvVW5vY2FsX0NvcnAuX3YuX01lc2FfUGV0cm9sZXVtX0NvLg/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B3e893a83).”)
        - 6.  Same as Thing 5 but you don’t make the threat explicit. “I want to buy 100% of this company and I’ll pay $50 per share in cash,” you say. But you have a reputation for being tough, and a history of treating minority shareholders poorly. The threat is implicit, so shareholders tender at $50 to avoid ending up in the minority of a company that you control.
        - These are the things, the classic things. They are “coercive takeover tactics,” in the lingo. They are ways for someone — a “corporate raider,” in the lingo — to take over a company without paying a fair price for it, or without offering every shareholder the same price. Or, I mean, _arguably_ without paying a fair price; you might think that some of these things are fine. (If you can get 51% of the shareholders of a company to sell you their stock in market transactions, what’s the problem?) But boards of directors of public companies generally take a dim view of these things. They think of themselves as fiduciaries for all of the shareholders, and they do not like the idea of someone buying the company out from under them. 
        - Instead, the board of directors will prefer a nice tidy negotiation between the buyer and the board. The buyer comes to the board and offers a merger, and they negotiate the terms with each other. If the board agrees to a deal, it will generally involve the buyer paying the same price to every shareholder, and it will be a price that the board thinks reflects the full value of the company. Once the buyer has an agreement with the board, they will go out together, buyer and board, and seek shareholder approval. (Either by signing a merger agreement and submitting it to a shareholder vote, or by doing a tender offer in which the buyer asks to buy all the shares from shareholders directly, but on terms approved by the board.) If the board does not agree to the deal, the buyer goes away peacefully and does not cause trouble by buying more stock, launching a tender offer to shareholders without board approval, or running a proxy fight in which the buyer tries to replace the board with its own nominees. That is the dignified, controlled way that corporate boards generally prefer to do mergers-and-acquisitions negotiations.
        - Many buyers like to do M&A this way too. (If you are taking over a company, it helps to be friendly with the people running the company! You’ll need them to help you run the company!) But some buyers — the corporate raiders, etc. — like to retain the ability to go hostile, to do unsolicited tender offers or proxy fights if the board rejects their offers. For one thing, sometimes boards are unreasonable, and going directly to the shareholders is the only way to get a deal done. For another thing, the _threat_ of going hostile can be helpful in negotiations with the board.
        - In the U.S., the board has a powerful tool in this fight. It is the poison pill. (Everyone calls it that, though its technical legal name is a “shareholder rights plan.”) The board of directors of a company, feeling threatened by a big acquirer of its stock or a corporate raider proposing to buy the company, will adopt a “shareholder rights plan.” The gist of the plan is that if anyone — meaning, basically, the buyer — acquires more than X% of the company’s stock (often X is 15 or 20), then that person’s shares go poof. You can’t actually do that — you can’t make one shareholder’s shares go poof — but you can get arbitrarily close by allowing all of the _other_ shareholders of the company to buy many _more_ shares at a discount, or by giving them more shares for free. So you say “if anyone goes above 15% of the stock, then we will distribute one free share of stock for each existing share, _except_ that the person who went above 15% doesn’t get any of the free stock.” So if someone gets 15%, then everyone _else_’s shares get doubled, taking the acquirer down to about 8%.\[2\] (In theory you could do this repeatedly, so that the acquirer could _never_ get a controlling stake.)
        - The actual mechanics are a bit more complicated than that, but not worth worrying about\[3\]; even the summary in the previous paragraph is not worth worrying about. The point is that the pill makes it very bad for anyone to get above 15% of the stock — it basically makes their stock go poof — so nobody does. For a long time it was common to say that a poison pill had never been triggered; that is [not quite true](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubHcuY29tL3VwbG9hZC9wdWJjb250ZW50L19wZGYvcHViMjU2M18xLnBkZg/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B4bdaa05d) anymore, but it is still [close enough](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVhbGxhd3llcnMuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAxOC8wNy9wb2lzb24tcGlsbHMtdWgtdGhhdHMtbm90LWhvdy10aGV5LXdvcmsuaHRtbA/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B41f002d9). When a board adopts a poison pill, for all practical purposes that prevents a buyer from buying more than 15% of the stock, either in the open market or in a tender offer. So it forces the buyer to negotiate with the board. If the buyer wants to buy the company, it has to strike a deal with the board (which will then get rid of the pill); it can’t just go directly to the shareholders to buy stock, because the pill will make its shares go poof.
        - (Some disclosure: The poison pill was invented by the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where I worked briefly in the mid-2000s. In my discussion of takeover defenses and tactics, I am drawing on Wachtell’s “[Takeover Law and Practice](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xyay5jb20vd2ViZG9jcy93bHJrbmV3L0NsaWVudE1lbW9zL1dMUksvV0xSSy4yNzA5NC4yMC5wZGY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B98b6357c)” guide, which is worth reading if you want more detail on how this all works. But I worked there a long time ago and any errors or oversimplifications here are not the firm’s fault.)
        - The poison pill is a bizarre and drastic thing for a board to do — to make one shareholder’s stock go poof! — and when it was invented in the 1980s there was some skepticism that it was legal. But the Delaware Supreme Court approved it, in [a 1985 decision](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9sYXcuanVzdGlhLmNvbS9jYXNlcy9kZWxhd2FyZS9zdXByZW1lLWNvdXJ0LzE5ODUvNTAwLWEtMmQtMTM0Ni0xLmh0bWw/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Ba32b714a), noting that the board’s reason for “the adoption of the Rights Plan was in reaction to what it perceived to be the threat in the market place of coercive two-tier tender offers” (my Thing 5 above). Basically the idea was that (1) corporate raiders sometimes do bad coercive things to take over companies, (2) boards have a fiduciary duty to _stop them_ and (3) drastic measures, like the poison pill, are justified to stop coercive takeover tactics.
        - But the pill quickly became a standard feature of corporate defense even against not-very-coercive actions. Boards of directors have successfully used poison pills to block non-coercive, all-shares-at-the-same-price tender offers, and to put limits on activists’ ability to run proxy fights. The broad general rule is that the board gets to decide on takeovers, and that if it acts in good faith to prevent a change of control, it can, even if shareholders would prefer to take the money.
        - So what does this have to do with Elon Musk.
        - This weekend, Twitter Inc.’s board  [adopted a poison pill](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTUvdHdpdHRlci1hZG9wdHMtcG9pc29uLXBpbGwtdG8td2FyZC1vZmYtbXVzay10YWtlb3Zlcj9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Ba4274d04) to protect itself against Elon Musk’s [plan to maybe acquire the company](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTUvc3VyZS1lbG9uLW11c2stbWlnaHQtYnV5LXR3aXR0ZXI_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B021984b5).

The main mechanism of the pill is that if Musk or anyone else acquires more than 15% of Twitter's stock, then every _other_ Twitter shareholder will have the right to pay $210 to acquire $420 worth of Twitter stock (at then-current market prices). 420 IS A WEED JOKE. Otherwise these numbers are sort of arbitrary — again, pills don’t get triggered, so the particular numbers don’t matter — and I imagine the conversation went like this:
        - > **Lawyer:** The pill will be structured to let other shareholders buy a large amount of stock at a discount to dilute Musk’s stake.
        - > 
        - > **Twitter:** How much stock?
        - > 
        - > **Lawyer:** It doesn’t really matter, but a lot, enough to swamp Musk. Typically the exercise price [would be](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWNhYmFjdXMuY29tL2RlZmVuc2UvcG9pc29uLXBpbGw/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B53479f4c) like $100 to $200, and you’d get twice as much stock, like, $200 to $400 worth.
        - > 
        - > **Twitter:** We are defending against Elon Musk here and ordinary tactics are not enough. We need to harness the power of the number 420. 
        - > 
        - > **Lawyer:** Okay then $420 worth of stock, whatever.
        - Another, perhaps more practical provision of the pill says that the board can just exchange each right for one share of stock, for free, meaning in essence that the board can double everyone else’s number of shares of Twitter while holding Musk’s constant, without asking anyone to put in more money. 
        - This weekend, Musk [tweeted](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTUxNTQwNTI2NDc0MDEzNDkxOA/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B13edb3cb) “Love Me Tender.” Because he is engaged in an annoying meme-driven maybe-hostile-takeover-battle, [everyone interpreted this](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTcvbXVzay1rZWVwcy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtb24tdGhlaXItdG9lcy13aXRoLWxvdmUtbWUtdGVuZGVyLXR3ZWV0P2NtcGlkPUJCRDA0MTgyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDQxOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bd705e536) to mean something like “maybe I will do a tender offer for Twitter, or maybe not, who knows, aren’t I a little scamp.” With the pill in place, he more or less can’t. He has to negotiate with the board, or run a proxy fight to replace the board,\[4\] or get other shareholders to pressure the board to get rid of the pill, or I suppose sue the board to get rid of the pill.
        - There is a [popular](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9BdmlrL3N0YXR1cy8xNTE0OTk4MzA5MTkwMDQ5Nzk1/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bd507c9da) [belief](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWNrLm5ld3MvdGhlLXR3aXR0ZXItYm9hcmRzLXBhbmljLXJvb20v/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B309c8e69) that, since Musk offered a cash acquisition at a price that is a decent premium to the market price, the board is somehow either obligated to accept his deal or at least obligated to let the shareholders decide.\[5\] This is wrong. The board gets to decide. From [Wachtell’s takeover guide](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xyay5jb20vd2ViZG9jcy93bHJrbmV3L0NsaWVudE1lbW9zL1dMUksvV0xSSy4yNzA5NC4yMC5wZGY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3C98b6357c):
        - > It seems clear that the target may, if it meets the relevant standard, “just say no” to an acquisition proposal. Targets of unsolicited offers have been successful in rejecting such proposals in order to follow their own strategic plans. …
        - > 
        - > While a rights plan \[i.e. poison pill\] is often the most useful tool for staving off a hostile bid, it is not necessary to successfully “just say no” in every situation. What is typically necessary—and what a rights plan is designed to protect—is a thoughtful long-term plan that was developed by a board and management whom long-term shareholders trust to deliver value.
        - The basic legal rule here is the “business judgment rule,” which is that the board of directors runs the company and courts do not generally second-guess their decisions if they are made carefully and in good faith. If Twitter’s board is advised by good bankers and lawyers, has no serious conflicts of interest, takes Musk’s offer seriously, and concludes that keeping Twitter independent and executing its strategic plan will be worth more to shareholders than Musk’s $54.20, then it can decline Musk’s offer.
        - There are other relevant rules. One is that, if the board _does_ decide to sell the company for cash, it needs to maximize value for shareholders. This is called the board’s “Revlon duty,” but it is pretty limited. It does _not_ mean that the board has to sell to Musk if his offer is higher than the current stock price. It just means that, _if_ the board _decides to sell for cash_, it needs to maximize value.\[6\] But even if the board does decide to sell, it could conceivably take another offer at a lower price than Musk’s bid, if either (1) the other deal is for _stock_, whose valuation is more subjective or (2) the other deal is, in the board’s judgment, more likely to be completed, for instance because it has actual financing and Musk’s doesn’t really.
        - Another relevant rule is that, if the board says no, any defensive measures it puts in place have to be reasonable. This is called the “Unocal standard.” The board [needs to show](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xyay5jb20vd2ViZG9jcy93bHJrbmV3L0NsaWVudE1lbW9zL1dMUksvV0xSSy4yNzA5NC4yMC5wZGY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3D98b6357c) that it has “reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy and effectiveness existed,” and that its defensive measures were “reasonable in relation to the threat posed.” This is also not that high a bar, though: The poison pill is a fairly standard defensive measure at this point, and the board’s conclusion that a takeover price is “inadequate” is generally enough of a threat.
        - Why would Twitter's board of directors want to stop Elon Musk? There is one main reason, which is that they (might) believe, in good faith, that the company is worth more than the $54.20 per share that he has offered to pay for it. This is of course a debatable point. Twitter was trading in the $70s last summer, so there is some recent evidence that it might be worth more than $54.20. But in the weeks before Musk built his stake, it was trading in the $30s, so the market no longer believes that. Twitter’s own performance is what caused the price decline, and it is not obvious that it will turn around soon.
        - Awkwardly, Twitter’s own adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (disclosure: I also used to work there) put a $30 price target on Twitter in February. (Twitter has also [hired JPMorgan](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTUvdHdpdHRlci1icmluZ3Mtb24tanBtb3JnYW4tYXMtYWR2aXNlci1hbG9uZ3NpZGUtZ29sZG1hbj9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bad3684d3); Bloomberg tells me its most recent price target is $56.) I know this because Musk [tweeted out the research report](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTUxNDcyNjk4MDkwOTk0ODkyOA/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bc360f4a7). Goldman’s research analysts, who put out this price target, are pretty independent from its investment bankers, who are advising Twitter, and there’s no reason that the bankers could not find the $54.20 price inadequate even as the analysts think Twitter would be lucky to get $30. But it is the sort of thing that Musk rightly makes fun of. Still, enough [shareholders](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTQvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcHJpbmNlLWFsd2FsZWVkLXJlamVjdHMtbXVzay1zLXR3aXR0ZXItYmlkP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA0MTgyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDQxOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bdeb649fc) and [analysts](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL25vLWJvYXJkLWluLWFtZXJpY2EtaXMtZ29pbmctdG8tdGFrZS10aGF0LW51bWJlci1hbmFseXN0LW9uLW11c2tzLXR3aXR0ZXItb2ZmZXItMTkwNDQyMzM0Lmh0bWw/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bcdbf7dc1) seem to think that $54.20 is inadequate that Twitter’s board, in its independent business judgment, could conclude the same thing. 
        - And so the board put in place a poison pill to stop Musk from going directly to the shareholders with his $54.20 bid. Maybe now Musk and the board will negotiate a higher price, perhaps $69. Or maybe now the board will find a higher bidder. Or maybe not; maybe the board will just say no to Musk and that will be that. It is not the most _common_ result in these situations, just because then the stock would probably go back down, at least in the short run, and shareholders would be mad. But it is a thing that the board can do, and that a court generally won’t second-guess.
        - But I also want to spend some time on _other_ reasons that a board of directors might want to stop Elon Musk, reasons in the general “coercive takeover tactics” bucket. Let me just list a few things that the board’s lawyers might say if this poison pill ever gets litigated.
        - First, Musk _did_ acquire 9.1% of the company secretly, in the open market, paying prices in the high $30s to get a start on his takeover without paying a control premium. Crucially, he seems to have done some of this acquiring _illegally:_ He was required by law to disclose his ownership stake, and probably his intention to take over the company, by March 24, but he waited until April 4 to make that disclosure, and claimed to be a passive investor when he finally did. This delay allowed him to buy an extra 13 million shares at lower prices, [saving him (and costing shareholders) on the order of $140 million](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMDYvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWlzLWFjdGl2ZS1ub3c_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bace46f2e).
        - The consensus seems to be that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can’t do much about this, and while there is a [shareholder lawsuit about it already](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuYndieC5pby9kb2N1bWVudHMvdXNlcnMvaXFqV0hCRmRmeElVL3J5Q2tjRmNPWEFtOC92MA/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B000f0d2e), it’s not clear that that will accomplish much either. Sometimes companies will ask courts to “sterilize” an acquirer’s shares, preventing him from voting them, if he acquired them in violation of the disclosure rules, but those requests [don’t have much success](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVhbGxhd3llcnMuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAxMS8wNy9zZWN0aW9uLTEzZC1yZXBvcnRpbmctY3N4LWNhc2UtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1uZWVkLWZvci1zZWMtYWN0aW9uLW9uLWRlcml2YXRpdmVzLmh0bWw/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B07ddb195). Basically Musk seems to have broken the law to buy his shares, but no one can do much about it.
        - But Twitter can stop him from buying _more_ stock secretly, by implementing the pill. It can reasonably argue that it is protecting shareholders from being tricked by illegal secret stock accumulation, and that Musk has already demonstrated that he is willing to do illegal secret stock accumulation. 
        - Second, Musk has arguably made at least one coercive threat: He [has said](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzAwMDE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTEwNDY1OTIyMDQ1NjQxL3RtMjIxMjc0OGQxX3NjMTNkYS5odG0/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Ba1cdcfae), in his public communications to the board, that if he can’t buy Twitter at $54.20 he will dump his 9.1% stake, driving down the stock price. This does not strike me as a particularly bad coercive threat — it doesn’t really leave Twitter worse off than it was before he arrived — but Tulane law professor Ann Lipton [argued on Twitter](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9hbm5tbGlwdG9uL3N0YXR1cy8xNTE0NTU3MzE2MzEzNjI0NTc2P3M9MTEmdD1WYjVycVFMSTVoaWVJV2tHdk9SVzdB/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B77449633) that “shareholders asked to vote or tender on this offer would be doing so under threat, which the Board is legally entitled to protect against,” and I think it is certainly an argument that the board could make.
        - Third, Musk has said that he wants to buy all of Twitter at $54.20 per share. But he has also implied that he _doesn’t_. At a conference last week, Musk [said that he intends](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTQvbXVzay1zYXlzLWhlLXMtbm90LXN1cmUtaGUtbGwtc3VjY2VlZC13aXRoLXR3aXR0ZXItYWNxdWlzaXRpb24_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bb21bd273) “to retain as many shareholders as is allowed by the law in a private company.” It is not at all clear what he means by that, or how seriously he means it. But it is reminiscent of what he said when he briefly pretended he was going to take Tesla Inc. private: He wanted to allow Tesla’s existing public shareholders to roll over into the private company. (It was not clear then either what he meant.) And, crucially,  _[that was part of his financing plan](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDgtMTMvZnVuZGluZy1mb3ItZWxvbi1tdXNrLXMtdGVzbGEtYnV5b3V0LXdhc24tdC1zby1zZWN1cmU_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bb4f8e780):_ He claimed that his takeover of Tesla would not require the full amount of cash to buy out all the shares, because he assumed a lot of public shareholders would roll over.
        - The financing for Musk’s Twitter bid [is also murky](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTUvc3VyZS1lbG9uLW11c2stbWlnaHQtYnV5LXR3aXR0ZXI_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3C021984b5), and I suppose it might rely on the same sort of vague wishful assumption that a lot of shareholders will roll over. Musk will need about $40 billion to buy out all of Twitter’s shares that he does not already own, but what if his plan is to spend, say, $25 billion, and to assume that holders of the other $15 billion will roll their stock over into a new Twitter, controlled by Elon Musk?
        - If he negotiates a merger with the board, then the board can insist on protections for the shareholders: It can require that shareholders be given a choice of cash or stock, that there be enough funding for everyone to elect cash, that the shareholders get full disclosure before electing, etc. Maybe some shareholders _will_ want to roll their shares into Musk Twitter.
        - But if Musk launches a hostile tender offer _without_ negotiating with the board, he might try to finesse this point. He might offer to buy, you know, 75% of the company or whatever, saying “I am confident that a lot of shareholders will want to keep their shares so I am not offering to buy it all.” You might end up in coercive-takeover territory, where some shareholders want to cash out but can’t, or where some shareholders rush to cash out because they fear getting stuck with stock in a Musk-controlled Twitter.\[7\] This would be pretty weird, and I do not think it is particularly likely, but it is a possibility given his history and his statements and his caginess about his financing. And I could see Twitter’s board justifying the pill on these grounds too, as a way to prevent Musk from buying less than all of Twitter on the cheap.
        - Anyway this Wednesday is April 20, that is, 4/20, the holiest day of the year for people who can’t stop making weed jokes, like Musk and, now, Twitter. I assume that on Wednesday morning either they will sign a friendly deal, or Musk will launch his tender offer (despite the pill!?). Otherwise they’ll have to wait until June 9.
        - Elsewhere in all this:
        - At FT Alphaville, [Sujeet Indap](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvYzUyYWVhNjctOWU2YS00ZTA0LWFkYzItNzQ0YmM0ZTBiNzM4P3NoYXJlVHlwZT1ub25naWZ0/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B7d337785) built an LBO model suggesting that there’s a way for a Twitter acquisition to work out.
        - At the Diff, [Byrne Hobart](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGlmZi5jby9wL3RvLWVsb24tc3ViamVjdC1jb25ncmF0dWxhdGlvbnM/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bc106e228) has some strategic suggestions for whoever ends up owning Twitter.
        - Here is [a Bloomberg News story from last week](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTQvbXVzay1zLXJldGFpbC1pbnZlc3Rvci1hcm15LWNvdWxkLW9mZmVyLXR3aXR0ZXItdGFrZW92ZXItaG9wZT9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Ba8c5630c) about Elon Musk’s retail-investor fans buying Twitter stock. They don’t seem to be buying _that much_, though: “The $423.9 million added from retail traders since the disclosure of his stake, for instance, equals about 1.2% of Twitter’s current market value.” Meanwhile, given the stock price, it does not seem like merger arbitrageurs are piling into Twitter stock because they expect a deal to get done.
        - Recently Musk has been going around complaining that, when he pretended in 2018 that he was going to take Tesla Inc. private, he really did have “funding secured.” I [remember reading](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTgtMDktMjgvbXVzay1zLXRlc2xhLWZ1bi1kb2VzLW5vdC1hbXVzZS1zZWM_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bafb9125b) the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint against Musk in 2018, and it seemed pretty clear that he had had only the vaguest of chats about funding; in the subsequent years he has never provided any evidence at all that he actually had the funding. He signed a settlement with the SEC over this incident, and his [current complaining](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9LZXViaWtvL3N0YXR1cy8xNTE0OTQ0Mzc5MzMyNDgxMDI0L3Bob3RvLzI/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B1b394df5) seems like [a violation of that settlement](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9vcnRoZXJlYWJvb3Qvc3RhdHVzLzE1MTQ2NjU5MzMzMzk2MDI5NDk/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bc9db80fa). None of this matters to the Twitter bid, I guess, but it remains annoying.
        - Also a judge seems to have ruled that, when he said he had “funding secured,” [that was false](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTYvbXVzay1nby1wcml2YXRlLXR3ZWV0LXJ1bGVkLWZhbHNlLWJ5LWp1ZGdlLXRlc2xhLWludmVzdG9ycy1zYXk_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDQxODIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwNDE4JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B03ce00a6)?

        - ## Meanwhile in crypto
        - Here’s a trade you can’t do:
        - 1.  Find a small publicly traded bank. Say it’s a bank with $10 billion of assets, with an equity market capitalization of $1 billion. (These are realistic numbers; the market value of a bank’s stock will generally be much lower than the value of its assets, because most of those assets are in effect owed to its depositors.\[8\])
        - 2.  Buy 51% of the stock for $510 million or whatever. 
        - 3.  Vote out the board, vote in a new board and make yourself the chief executive officer.
        - 4.  Take the $10 billion in the vault and send it to yourself, making $10 billion on your $510 million investment.
        - 5.  Smirk “what, I own the bank, I take the money, that’s how it works.”
        - That’s not how it works, you can’t do this,\[9\] if you did do it you would go to prison, but you’d be stopped well before that point. But in its outlines it is a tempting and elegant trade, and we have [talked about variations](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDMtMDEvaW5zdXJhbmNlLWlzLXdoZXJlLXRoZS1tb25leS1pcz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B05432122) that work a little better. (The guy we talked about [_did_ go to prison](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9pbnN1cmFuY2UtZXhlY3V0aXZlLWdyZWctbGluZGJlcmctc2VudGVuY2VkLXRvLXNldmVuLXllYXJzLWFuZC10aHJlZS1tb250aHMtaW4tcHJpc29uLTExNTk3ODc3MzY3/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B96211f81), though he did get the money first, so his version worked only a little better.)
        - The basic idea of the trade is that there exist in the world some very large pots of money — banks, insurance companies, asset managers, etc. — that are _controlled_ by relatively small _companies_. It takes a smaller amount of money to buy control of the company, and then you get to decide what to do with the larger pot of money that the company manages. In the world of traditional finance, this is a well-known problem, and those pots of money tend to be very carefully regulated to guard against some opportunist taking control of them on the cheap and draining the money from the pot.
        - In crypto, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. you know how this is gonna go. Here’s [Anthony Lee Zhang on Twitter](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9hbnRob255bGVlemhhbmcvc3RhdHVzLzE1MTU3MDIyNzYzOTYxMzAzMDc_cz0yMSZ0PU5Qb0FVbDJnMVRPc0pNWHRPUW5UNVE/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bfb557b04):

        - > 
        - > The way an algo-stable works, there's an equity layer and a debt (stablecoins) layer, and possibly a bunch of reserves, so the equity layer effectively has control over a bunch of "stuff" that the protocol owns

        - > 2\. Buy a bunch of equity tokens and vote the change in  
        - > 3\. Send the entire treasury to your address A
        - And here is [CoinDesk’s summary](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tL3RlY2gvMjAyMi8wNC8xNy9hdHRhY2tlci1kcmFpbnMtMTgybS1mcm9tLWJlYW5zdGFsay1zdGFibGVjb2luLXByb3RvY29sLw/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B10f30051):
        - > The attacker took out a flash loan on lending platform Aave which enabled them to amass a large amount of Beanstalk’s native governance token, Stalk. With the voting power granted by these Stalk tokens, the attacker was able to quickly pass a malicious governance proposal that drained all protocol funds into a private Ethereum wallet.
        - Various crypto pots of money are controlled by governance tokens, and the market capitalization of the governance token is often a lot lower than the value in the pot, for basically the same reasons that the market capitalization of a bank is generally much lower than the value of the bank’s assets. And the governance token can, by majority vote, decide what to do with the pot. (Sometimes — many pots are better designed than this!) And in crypto, you can often do a series of transactions as a single integrated transaction, in which you take out a flash loan to buy all the governance tokens, vote the governance tokens to give yourself the pot of money, use some of the pot to repay the flash loan and keep the rest for yourself — all at once. And so someone did. 
        - Again: You could do exactly this trade with a _bank_, instead of a stablecoin, if banks were stupidly designed. But they are not!
        - _\[8\] This is obvious to banking people but perhaps not to everyone: The way a bank works is that it takes deposits (and owes money back to depositors) and uses them to make loans, buy bonds, etc. A bank with $10 billion of assets might have $9 billion of deposits and $1 billion of equity value. It has $10 billion of stuff, it owes $9 billion back to depositors, so there’s $1 billion left over, which belongs to its shareholders. The point is just that banks are very \*leveraged\*; they fund most of their assets with deposits, so the assets are worth way more than the equity value of the bank. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a market capitalization of about $370 billion._

The way TAS works is that, sometime in the middle of the trading day, I agree to buy futures from you at the end of the day, for whatever the closing (settlement) price happens to be (plus or minus a few pennies of premium or discount). We agree on a quantity but not a price; we just take whatever the closing price is as the price for our trade.
        - You might be doing this because you are a price-insensitive natural seller. I, on the other hand, might be an arbitrageur or market maker or prop trader; I might not want to end up owning all those futures. I will hedge my transaction: I’ll buy 100 contracts from you via TAS, and then sell 100 contracts in the market — at actual prices — to end up flat. I might try to do this hedging sometime near the close of trading that day, so that my selling prices will roughly match the settlement price at which I am buying.
        - If I do a lot of selling _right at the close_, that will have a tendency to drive down the closing price. If there are no other big _buyers_ right at the close, this can be very lucrative for me. For instance if the price is $20, half an hour before the close, and I start selling a bunch and the price drops to $10, and if I sell some more and it drops to $0, and I sell even more and it drops to negative $10, and so forth, I might end up selling my contracts at an average price of, say, negative $10, and then I buy from you at the settlement price of, say, negative $37.63, which was the actual closing price of West Texas Intermediate crude futures on April 20, 2020. So I make $27.63 per barrel. 
        - A point that I often make is that it is very hard, in this scenario, to distinguish proper “hedging” (I am long TAS, so I hedge by selling futures) from improper “manipulation” (I am long TAS, so I push down the settlement price by selling futures). Or rather, two related points that I often make are:
        - 1.  It is hard to distinguish hedging from manipulation just by looking at trading history, but
        - 2.  The way people distinguish these things in practice is by looking at the traders’ chat logs and see if they say things like “boy I really manipulated that price, hope I don’t go to prison.”
        - Anyway the people who made money trading TAS oil contracts that day [had some bad chat logs](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMTMvLXBsZWFzZS1kb24tdC10ZWxsLWVzc2V4LWJveXMtdGV4dHMtc3B1ci1qdWRnZS10by1hbGxvdy1zdWl0P2NtcGlkPUJCRDA0MTgyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDQxOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bcc67713f):
        - > At 3:29 p.m. on April 20, 2020 -- the only day that oil prices have ever dropped below zero -- a British trader sent a message to his buddies: “We pushed each other so hard for years for this one moment … And we f\[\*\*\*\*\*\*\] blitzed it boys.”

        - _\[1\] Don’t take this too literally. Some of these things are pretty hard to do. The second-step merger in Thing 3, for instance, would probably be subject to entire fairness review as I describe it in the text, and you’d be unlikely to get away with it. Even in Thing 1, your appointed directors will have fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and buying 51% in the open market seems hard. I am describing these things to illustrate the concepts, not because they can really all be done._
        - _\[2\] That is, the acquirer has 15 shares and everyone else combines for 85. Then everyone else gets doubled, giving them 170, while the acquirer still only has 15, or 15/185 = 8.1% of the stock._
        - _\[3\] The traditional “flip-in” pill operates by distributing “rights” to shareholders, basically options to buy shares; if an acquirer “triggers” the pill by going above 15%, then the rights become exercisable. Generally the rights have an exercise price that is rather higher than the current stock price, and you can buy stock with a current market value of 200% of the exercise price. So you have to pay, say, $210 to get $420 worth of stock. Shareholders would be expected to exercise the rights, buying a lot of stock and diluting the acquirer. Modern pills also have an “exchange” provision that works like I said in the text: Instead of asking shareholders to put up a bunch more cash (which they might not do!), the exchange provision just gives every shareholder one free share in exchange for their rights, diluting the acquirer._
        - _\[4\] Which would take forever. Twitter’s annual meeting to elect directors is already [scheduled for May 25](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTE0MDM2MTIyMDE0MDQ5L255MjAwMDE5MjF4M19kZWYxNGEuaHRt/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B05b4ede1), and Musk is probably too late to run a proxy fight for that meeting. Also Twitter has a classified board, meaning that only one-third of directors are elected each year, so he would have to win two proxy fights to get a board majority. Incidentally, Twitter is [trying to \*get rid of\* the classified board](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTE0MDM2MTIyMDE0MDQ5L255MjAwMDE5MjF4M19kZWYxNGEuaHRtI3RQNA/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B2a91bfd3), which requires an 80% vote of shareholders, though I wonder if it regrets that effort given Musk’s arrival._
        - _\[5\] William Cohan [suggests](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWNrLm5ld3MvdGhlLXR3aXR0ZXItYm9hcmRzLXBhbmljLXJvb20v/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3C309c8e69) that if “the $54.20 price is ‘fair,’ from a financial point of view,” then Twitter’s board “will have little choice but to accept Musk’s offer.” This is not quite how it works. In general, a board can reject an offer that it thinks is inadequate. Sometimes it will get an opinion from a financial adviser saying that the offer is inadequate. In general, a board can accept an offer that it thinks is fair; almost always, it will get an opinion from a financial adviser saying that the offer is fair. \*These are different words\*, and while they may not \*mean\* anything different, they allow for wiggle room. Thus a board can reject an offer of $54.20 per share and get an “inadequacy” opinion saying $54.20 is inadequate, and then later decide it has no choice but to accept the same offer and get a “fairness” opinion saying $54.20 is fair, and the opinions will be from the same bank and based on the same facts, and it’s all fine. “The price can be considered fair but still inadequate,” [wrote Steven Davidoff](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAwOC8wMy8zMC9idXNpbmVzcy93b3JsZGJ1c2luZXNzLzMwaWh0LWRlYWwuMS4xMTUyNzY5MC5odG1s/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3B2a95c568) about this practice in 2008, and: “Since financial valuation is a subjective exercise and there are no set, agreed guidelines or practices for it, there is substantial leeway for investment banks to arrive at their client's desired conclusion.” The narrow point here is that, if Twitter wanted to do this deal, it could probably get a fairness opinion from its advisers saying that $54.20 is “fair,” but that does not in any way obligate Twitter to take the deal._
        - _\[6\] I am oversimplifying when I say “sell for cash,” though it is a customary oversimplification. Delaware law has an annoying concept of a “change of control,” in which selling a company for cash changes its control, because the shareholders are cashed out and someone else controls the company, while selling it for stock does not, because the shareholders remain shareholders of the acquirer. But if the acquirer is itself a controlled company — if it has one big shareholder who will own a majority of the surviving company, etc. — then that is also a “change of control” and implicates Revlon. None of that seems important here._
        - _\[7\] Twitter’s board might add that Musk, as a controlling shareholder, has some history of disregard for minority shareholder rights. Currently some Tesla shareholders are [suing Musk over Tesla’s takeover of SolarCity](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27407897.269047/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDEtMTgvbXVzay1lbmdpbmVlcmVkLXNvbGFyY2l0eS1wdXJjaGFzZS1hcy1iYWlsb3V0LWludmVzdG9ycy1hcmd1ZT9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60f8d046d7230c59995389d3Bb68f76a7), another company that Musk controlled, arguing that the takeover benefited Musk at the expense of public shareholders. I don’t know how strong that case is, but again it’s something for the board to mention. Incidentally a ruling on that case is expected this month. Fun!_

        - The basic legal rule here is the “business judgment rule,” which is that the board of directors runs the company and courts do not generally second-guess their decisions if they are made carefully and in good faith. If Twitter’s board is advised by good bankers and lawyers, has no serious conflicts of interest, takes Musk’s offer seriously, and concludes that keeping Twitter independent and executing its strategic plan will be worth more to shareholders than Musk’s $54.20, then it can decline Musk’s offer.

            - > ### **Q: “I joined as a VP of Engineering at a scaleup with aggressive growth plans. My CEO is not technical. How can I set myself up for success?”**
            - Working with a non-technical CEO is a common challenge at scaleups and startups. I’ve heard this question asked by Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) and Vice Presidents of Engineering (VPE) joining seed-stage, Series A, Series B and later stage companies.
            - To answer this question I pulled in my friend [Paulo André](https://twitter.com/prla). Paulo is a former VP of Engineering who now coaches engineering leaders, full-time. He is high on the list of coaches for senior engineering managers and engineering leaders [whom I recommend](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/coaches-and-mentors-for-engineering-managers/). He also writes a weekly newsletter for technical leaders – [sign up for it here](https://hagakure.substack.com/).
            - So, as a new VP of Engineering, how can you set yourself up for success with a non-technical CEO? Over to Paulo:
            - Buckle up because it's going to be bumpy, painful, often frustrating, and potentially wonderful. At this point, you are no longer “just” building a product. Now, you’re building a company, too. The choices you make at this particular stage will have an outsized impact upon the future of the business. No pressure, right?
            - Through the lens of my own experience as a VP of Engineering (both as an operator and now coaching many who are knee-deep in it), I will attempt to boil down this key role to its essence. When things get crazy – and they _will_ get crazy – this will help keep you grounded, principled in the decisions you make, and confident in the actions you take. It won’t tell you _what_ to think, but it will help you in _how_ to think.
            - We will cover:
            - 1.  **Start with the end in mind.** The importance of this approach.
            - 2.  **Your role as a leader.** What is it, really?
            - 3.  **The mindset of an effective VP of Engineering.** Approaches to have more good days than bad.
            - 4.  **Learn, adapt and improve.** And how to do this all the time.

            - ## **1\. Start with the end in mind**
            - > _“If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.”_
            - > 
            - > — Seneca
            - “What is your goal?” is perhaps the question I most often ask the engineering leaders whom I coach. Too often we fall into the trap of _doing things_ for no good reason. Because the people and budget you have will _always_ be scarce, it’s critical to be picky about how you deploy what you have. And without clear objectives, how can you possibly know what you and your team need to become?
            - ### **Where are you going?**
                - While the nitty-gritty of the business might not be what gets you up in the morning, you must develop a solid high-level understanding of it. You should be able to explain to anyone what the main business metrics are and what tends to drive them. As the VP of Engineering, you are a translator between the engineering organization and everyone else.
                - A financing round is a means to an end. What is this end, in the case of your company? Consider asking your CEO questions like:
                - What growth are we expected to deliver based on this round?
                - What needs to be true for us to raise again?
                - Which major constraints do you currently see?
                - What are you most pessimistic and most optimistic about?
                - What is our current business strategy to achieve our goals?
                - This last question is particularly important, because your engineering strategy will hang on it.
            - ### **Who do you need to become?**
                - With a good idea of the next destination, which habits, practices and principles will get you and your team there? When Colin Breck, a senior staff engineer at Tesla, became a team lead back in 2016, he was very intentional about the standards of performance he expected from his organization. In a [classic blog post](https://blog.colinbreck.com/on-being-a-team-lead-welcome-to-our-team/), he wrote:
                - > _“I want our team to have a reputation for delivering very high quality software systems and, at the same time, being very aggressive in evolving the systems to deliver valuable innovations to the business. This can't happen without the right investments in the technical practices that lead to good software development: intentional design, code reviews, pair programming, static analysis, automated testing, automated deployments, monitoring of production systems, and so on.”_
                - In my case, some of my values are a belief in self-organizing teams, putting teams above individuals, and creating leaders not followers. It is my conviction that these drive an engaged, productive and ever-improving engineering organization. Which values will matter for you?
                - Remember that as a leader, whether you like it or not, you lead by example – good or bad. The responsibility of upholding standards rests on your shoulders more than anybody else’s. Take the time to think about what is non-negotiable for you, articulate it to your team, and don’t compromise on it.
                - With that backbone in place, what should you then be paying attention to?
            - ## **2\. Your role as a leader**

            - One of my mistakes as a first-time VP of Engineering was focusing almost entirely on my engineering team at the expense of other constituencies and stakeholders. This was akin to trying to run with my shoelaces tied together, as I was missing out on creating the necessary shared context with all involved.
            - The [Jobs To Be Done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) framework starts from the premise that as a business, your customers are “hiring” you to do a job for them. This framing helps you to uncover their needs and work toward meeting them. Same applies to your VP of Engineering role:
            - What job is my CEO hiring me to do?
            - What job are my peers (e.g. others “heads of”) hiring me to do?
            - What job is my team hiring me to do?
            - These three questions help you frame what I call _directions of concern_ that you must keep in mind at all times.
            - ### **What job is my CEO hiring me to do?**
                - Many VPEs simply don’t have this conversation, assume everything, and then wonder why the CEO “doesn’t get it.” It is your role to help them understand it. The challenge with a non-technical boss is that they will likely not have a good grasp of how engineering works ‘under the hood.’ Many CEOs had traumatizing experiences which tainted their perception of engineering.
                - *Help your CEO understand how engineering works.** Walk them through the end-to-end software development lifecycle, where you see the existing pain points and constraints, what your plans for alleviating them are, and what the business gains from it.
                - A non-technical CEO will still frequently question why a specific feature or project isn’t easier, faster or cheaper to build. It’s easy to get frustrated when this happens. Catch yourself – and become curious instead. What might explain your CEO’s perspective?
                - Instead of trying to justify why your plan is the correct one, ask questions. Aim to clarify their position and what they are comparing this against. Clarifying not only helps refine your argument; it also makes the CEO feel heard. 
                - As the gaps in understanding between you and your CEO are filled, the whole thing frequently becomes a non-issue. As author Stephen Covey writes in the classic book _[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B0868STGGP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GH45LPL2VLZQ&keywords=The+7+Habits+of+Highly+Effective+People&qid=1647624869&sprefix=the+7+habits+of+highly+effective+people%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-1)_:
                - > “Seek first to understand then to be understood.”
                - *A typical failure between CEOs and their VPs is a misalignment on what success looks like.** Without alignment, it’s unlikely the relationship will be productive. In extreme cases, the CEO becomes a micromanager, meddling with the internals of your team. You don’t want to be in that hell and if you take extreme ownership of your role (which you should), you won’t be.
                - Think of it as defining an _interface_ between you both: what does the CEO care about coming from engineering and how will you agree to measure it? Typically this will be some delivery metrics, but some CEOs are also interested in the engagement and happiness of teams, too. Whatever it is, work together on defining this interface, keep it as a backdrop in 1:1s, and refine it as you go along. Rule of thumb: minimize surprises.
            - ### **What job are my peers hiring me to do?**
                - Tech is everywhere in startups these days which means almost every department essentially has engineering needs. A classic example is the marketing team wanting to spin up their own engineering team because product engineering isn’t giving them any bandwidth. Sound familiar?
                - It doesn’t have to be this way. You will never have enough resources to cover everything everyone wants. But the good news is that not everything is truly necessary. You (hopefully) don’t just go and build whatever your customers tell you they want. Instead, you understand their pain points and then decide how to address the most critical ones in your product. Likewise, you should treat your peers with the same curiosity and interest:
                - What are their goals?
                - What are their priorities?
                - What is constraining them?
                - What are they hoping your team can help with, and when?
                - What is their understanding of how engineering works?
                - Your goal should be getting to the core of what matters to them, and then speaking to that. In my experience, people are fine being told what they want is not possible. What they hate is false promises, or being ignored.
                - The collaboration with your Product counterpart is especially critical. Spend a lot of time together building shared mental models of how you’ll tackle the _why, what,_ and _how_ between your teams, and how they’ll work effectively together.
            - ### **What job is my team hiring me to do?**
                - At its most essential, the VP of Engineering role is to enable a framework and create discipline around it. Some say you are the ‘gardener who tends the soil in which beautiful flowers can bloom.’ Or that you ‘provide the canvas for your team to paint great works of art.’ Or the classic ‘provider of guardrails’ between which productive work happens. All of these have a kernel of truth.
                - Why a framework, you ask? In a nutshell: _decentralized decision-making_. You must bias towards providing [context over control](https://pulseasync.com/operators/future-remote-working/). The reasons are plenty:
                - **It’s the core of agility.** Velocity matters, and if shifting direction depends on a bunch of sign-offs and “alignment,” you’re dead in the water. A nimble organization is quick to sense and respond only once everyone has that ability.
                - **It drives innovation.** Centralized processes imply that some elite group knows what should be done, and everyone else executes. That’s poisonous to creativity. Centralization may help execution, but it’s a killer of innovation.
                - **It’s motivating.** Autonomy is a necessary condition for humans to thrive. True autonomy implies having _choice_. If I have no choice in what I do or how I do it, I’m not in charge of my own destiny. How exciting is it to be a cog in the machine?
                - **It enables delegation.** The more decisions every individual contributor is able to make, the fewer meetings you feel compelled to be in. Good news for you and your managers. Are you starting to see a way out of your Tetris-like calendar?
                - **It’s the fuel for learning.** We learn by trial and error. But we don’t learn much (if anything) from decisions we didn’t make. Let folks make their own decisions – and hold them accountable for _learning from what happens_. Learning compounds; the more you learn, the better you get at learning.
                - As the leader, you have to continuously ask yourself, _what will enable each of my team members to make the best possible decisions within their scope?_ This is where having a clear strategy is key.
                - ### **Engineering Strategy**
                - Speed alone isn’t enough. Going really fast where you shouldn’t go, is a recipe for disaster. I prefer to think of **velocity**; speed _coupled with_ direction. That’s what engineering strategies, in part, enable. When everyone is a vector pointing in the right direction, we can more confidently accelerate.
                - Perhaps no word has been more abused in the business world than “strategy”. But it doesn’t have to be that way. As Richard Rumelt writes in his seminal book _[Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239)_ (emphasis mine):
                - > _Rather, the term “strategy” should mean **a cohesive response to an important challenge**. Unlike a stand-alone decision or a goal, a strategy is a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments, **and actions** that respond to a high-stakes challenge._
                - I want to rehabilitate the idea of strategy by focusing on two key aspects of a good strategy:
                - **It’s a cohesive response to an important challenge.** This means it must be a one-stop shop for clearly understanding the situation at hand, why it matters, and how it will be tackled.
                - **It includes action.** Most strategies forget the most important detail: _what will we do?_ Rumelt reminds us that “execution problems” typically mean strategy got confused with goal setting. That’s just hope, and hope is not a strategy.
                - How to write a great engineering strategy is beyond the scope of this piece, but fortunately there’s plenty of good resources about it. I recommend the writings of [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/engineering-strategy/), [Mathias Meyer](https://www.paperplanes.de/2020/1/31/on-drafting-an-engineering-strategy.html) and [Pete Hodgson](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2019/12/09/delivering-on-an-architecture-strategy/).
                - Note that these strategies can be nested. A top-level engineering org strategy which is necessarily focused on the big picture, can then include “sub-strategies” that serve as finer-grained guidance across multiple domains:
                - Engineering Strategy
                    - Technical architecture
                        - Microservices
                        - CI/CD
                        - …
                    - Software Development Lifecycle
                        - Coding standards
                        - Code review
                        - …
                    - Recruiting
                        - Hiring process
                        - Onboarding new teammates
                    - Build vs. Buy decisions
                    - Specific projects (i.e. a technical migration)
                - While it may take longer to build these documents collaboratively, it’s an investment that pays dividends every single day – including when onboarding new joiners. A good set of engineering strategy documents is a wonderful mechanism for creating clarity, leading to better decisions consistently.
            - ### **The “Top of Mind” Email**
                - Strategy is not a one-and-done thing. It must be repeated, often. One of my favorite tools for this is something I learned from [Patrick Kua](https://www.patkua.com/about/) which I call the “weekly top of mind.” If a set of engineering strategies is a _mechanism for clarity_, this is a _mechanism for discipline_.
                - Every Friday morning, I would send an email to my entire team (cc’ing my peers in the leadership team) in which I shared my current thinking. While this might sound borderline narcissistic, the idea is that if I’m doing my job right, the most important things _should_ be what’s on my mind. This allowed me to check a few boxes every week:
                - **Reinforce priorities.** When there’s abundance (of people, money, etc.) we start sucking at prioritization. Everything goes. I tried hard to keep the team centered on what was most important for us at that particular moment.
                - **Maintain shared context.** As a member of the leadership team, there was often context or news I learned from leadership team meetings that I felt would be important for the team.
                - **Showcase what ‘good’ looks like.** When a team member would do a great job on something meaningful in our culture (e.g. a really well written [RFC document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)), I would showcase it for all to see. This helped set our standards of performance, and doubled as appreciation and gratitude.
                - **Share learning resources.** I would disseminate links to resources on whatever we were trying to improve on (e.g. something about [Theory of Constraints](https://www.amazon.com/Bottleneck-Rules-More-Working-Harder-ebook/dp/B07DCFR7B4) when improving our development flow, or how to conduct great technical interviews.)
                - Having a structure for this email and then collecting notes and ideas throughout the week made the writing less painful and more efficient. At some point, I could crank one of these out in under an hour – and considered it one of highest-leverage activities I could do.
            - ## **3\. The mindset of an effective VP of Engineering**
                - I have no problem saying that I got quite burnt out towards the end of my first VP of Engineering gig. That was largely because I put myself last. But I can also confidently say I learned to do better. The following five ideas helped me have increasingly more good days than bad:
                - 1.  **The Dichotomy of Control**_**.**_ There is so much in startups that you simply _cannot_ control – and a lot of the stress comes from trying to. The [dichotomy of control](https://thestoicsage.com/dichotomy-of-control/) in [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/) reminds you to focus your energy on what you can control (e.g. what you do, how you react) and to leave the rest to fate. As the late football coach Bill Walsh used to say, “the score takes care of itself.”
                - 2.  **Pay attention to what has your attention**_**.**_ Your attention directs where your time and energy goes. Everyone’s time is precious, but yours as VP of Engineering is particularly so, given you have by definition the largest scope. You have to pay attention to what you're paying attention to. Is it serving your goals? As [Naval Ravikant](https://fs.blog/knowledge-podcast/naval-ravikant/) put it, “run your mind in debugging mode.”
                - 3.  **Pareto is your friend.** The [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, a nearly universal law. What are the _vital few_ activities (as opposed to the _trivial many_) you should be engaged in that will create 80% of the positive impact for your team? For example, time spent on improving the hiring process itself yields better hires, which makes everything else easier. That’s leverage.
                - 4.  **Mind the Rider** _**and**_ **the Elephant.** As engineers, we usually default to appealing to the mind – the rider. But as the Heath brothers tell us in their book _[Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385528752/)_, you also have to appeal to the elephant – the heart. Once I learned that the rider is hopeless if the elephant refuses to move, I understood you need to appeal to the heart, first. Game changer.
                - 5.  **Reject zero-sum thinking.** When things heat up, it’s easy to slip into an “us vs. them” mindset. That’s when zero-sum thinking takes over. Approaching problems as challenges that you intend to solve collaboratively elicits the best from others, too. Less “either/or” and more “Yes, and…” is the gateway to better collaboration.
            - ## **4\. Learn, adapt, improve – all the time**
                - Customers are the only real judges of the value of whatever you build. Hence, you have to put your best guesses in their hands quickly, and learn from what they do with it – what Eric Ries calls the “[Build-Measure-Learn](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/build-measure-learn.htm)” loop.
                - Likewise, if you look at your engineering organization as a _product_ to be continuously improved, the same exact model applies. Every change in structure, process, or even people, should have a hypothesis attached implying a key question; _what will be true if this change is successful?_ For example, “if we implement [work-in-progress limits](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits), we should see a decrease in overall [cycle time](https://codeclimate.com/blog/software-engineering-cycle-time/).”
                - ### **Learning is not optional**
                - Learning, adapting and improving is _way more_ important than racking our brains trying to get everything right, off the bat. No matter what your starting point is, if you learn fast, inevitably you’ll figure things out and [get](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement) _[really](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement)_ [good](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement). This has an interesting and desirable side-effect; it relieves you (and everyone else) from the pressure of having to know everything upfront, or making the perfect decision. In an uncertain world, adaptability eats predictability for breakfast.
                - The infamous sprint retrospectives are a good example. While this is technically a Scrum artifact, self-reflection writ large certainly isn’t. Whatever the mechanism, each team must come together regularly and engage in _real talk_ towards its own self-improvement. Too many teams blindly follow the retrospective format _du jour_ and lose sight of what matters, which is finding out what’s the next small step team members can take together to become a better team.
                - As the VP of Engineering, your job is not to run the retrospectives yourself, but rather to make sure these not only happen, but are themselves increasingly more effective. Create the _discipline_ of constant learning by whatever means necessary and at some point you won’t have to – it becomes part of the lifeblood of the organization.
                - ### **Feedback Loops**
                - As an engineer, you run your tests and it’s either green or red. That’s a very short feedback loop right there. When it comes to engineering management, the feedback loops aren’t so obvious anymore, yet they’re critical. Without them, learning and improvement can’t happen.
                - Here are a few examples of metrics and associated feedback loops:
                - **Cycle time.** How long does it take on average between development starting on a piece of work and it being in production? This is a _quantitative_ metric of flow. Better flow is good for the “build-measure-learn” cycle we talked about earlier. So if a team makes a change in its process, how is cycle time being affected?
                - **Team health.** What is a healthy team? This is a subjective concept, and can be a compound of _qualitative_ (e.g. ease of release, learning, sense of autonomy) and _quantitative_ (e.g. the [DORA metrics](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Nicole-Ph-D-Forsgren/dp/1942788339)). If a team changes one of its processes, what are we expecting to see in these metrics?
                - **Engagement surveys.** Employee engagement tools are often just tokens of good intentions. But they can be golden in helping you and your managers keep an ear to the ground; after all this is the ‘voice of the people.’ What are they saying? Think of it as the compound reaction to all your efforts as a whole in leading the engineering organization.
            - ## **In Closing**
            - In engineering management, it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees – there is always so much going on. You must consciously and regularly take a step back and reassess where you stand. The key ideas in this article will hopefully help you do so:
            - **Start with the end in mind**. Always be clear – to yourself and others – where you intend to go and _why_ it matters. Only then can you envision who you need to become to get there, and take the necessary steps together.
            - **Live up to your full role.** Consciously building great working relationships with your CEO and peers is the grease that makes everything easier. Lead through context, not control – the more good decisions are made by those close to the work, the more scalable your organization.
            - **Obsess about learning.** No matter where you start, it’s the capacity to learn and evolve that will get you where you want to be. Make learning a cultural non-negotiable. No change for the sake of it – feedback loops are essential to actually learn from change.
            - **Lead yourself first.** It’s a hard job. Self-care is (largely) about being honest with yourself on what you can and cannot control – and acting accordingly. Avoid _either/or_ absolutism, seek synergies, and be a storyteller who appeals to both hearts _and_ minds. That’s 80% of the way to success.
            - Whatever your specific framework ends up looking like, no matter how difficult things get, you must never forget that your team does not serve you – [you serve them](https://capwatkins.com/blog/management-power). They’re the ones making it all real. Hence, the question always nagging at you must be: _what the hell can I do to make all these people more and more successful?_
            - Remember: a rising tide lifts all boats.
