    - Fortunately, anyone can learn the skills mentioned by Housel. According to Brené Brown, “Empathy is best understood as a learned skill, because being empathetic, or having the capacity to show empathy, is not a quality that is innate or intuitive.” ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=329))
    - This suspension of judgment is critical for finding problems that you may not have realized existed. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=339))
    - ‘Who are the users, and what do they care about?” ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=358))
    - Being listened to makes people feel happy, and the person talking associates those positive feelings with the person and concept they’re talking about. In the case of a customer interview, that means those happy feelings get transferred to you and in turn, your company. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=381))
    - Here it is: listening to customers is embedded in everything we do. Listening to customers is the cornerstone, foundation, and pillars of how we make decisions. By listening to customers and learning their processes, we learn how to get and retain customers by helping them accomplish things faster, cheaper, and easier. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=391))
    - that would be needed by someone who has zero customer research training. The idea of ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=401))
    - Building products and features that people don’t want is painful and if people knew how to talk to customers and potential customers to get useful information, they wouldn’t have to go through that. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=414))
    - A week of user testing and then another two weeks of tweaking based on that feedback just wasn't in the cards for our hectic four-to-six week product launch cycles. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=439))
    - Practicing and applying empathy didn’t come naturally to me, and it’s something I’ve had to learn. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=444))
    - Launch a product See if people would pay for something Understand why people are canceling Know why people are buying, so you can find more customers Determine which features to add next Figure out how to keep customers and why people buy again ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=457))
    - Sometimes people think they need to solve the entire process in order to create something others would buy. This is sometimes the case, but due to the complexity that goes into even “simple” tasks, making just one step easier, faster, or cheaper can make a huge difference for people. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=526))
    - People are more willing to pay to solve problems that are frequent, and people are more willing to pay to solve problems that are complex, time consuming, expensive to get wrong, or otherwise frustrating in some way. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=533))
    - The scripts build off a set of core questions: What are they trying to do overall? What are all of the steps in that process? Where are they now? Where does the problem you are solving fit in that process? Where in that process do they spend a lot of time or money? How often do they experience this problem? What have they already tried? ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=549))
    - From that perspective, an individual product is inevitably only one (or two) steps in that process toward a larger goal. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=560))
    - A functional purpose An emotional dimension A social dimension ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=577))
    - How often they experience it What they’re currently paying to solve it How long it takes them ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=589))
    - Valuable: If the product isn’t something the customer needs, they won’t buy it. Usable: If the customer can’t figure out how to use it, they won’t use it (even if the value is there). Viable: If it doesn’t make money, the company will shut it down. Feasible: If it isn’t possible for the company to build, it will never get off the ground. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=601))
    - I encourage you to be gentle with yourself. Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=628))
    - You also may find interviewing more tiring. I generally recommend doing a maximum of two interviews per day, yet you may find that one per day or per week is more comfortable for you. I encourage you to find a method and approach that works for you. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=684))
    - In some cases, “leadership potential” is communicated by sharing one’s own ideas and being the loudest voice in the room. Talking is encouraged, rather than listening. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=691))
    - Validating how people feel is uncommon, too, even if you care about the person and the situation they’re in. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=692))
    - “How to Talk So People Will Talk” ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=716))
    - After the interview, listen back to the recording and analyze it from two different angles: first, the information you gathered, and second, how you conducted the interview. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=730))
    - Functional Factor(s) Emotional Factor(s) Social Factor(s) ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=737))
    - And Rachel was able to find all of that underlying emotion and memory even as a first-time interviewer, with about the same amount of training on qualitative customer research that you’ve received by reading this book to this point. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=807))
    - Someone you know vaguely and not too closely. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=821))
    - A script (below) Someone to interview Fifteen to twenty minutes A way to record the interview ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=829))
    - What is the underlying problem/need this product solved for them? How often do they experience the problem? Were they previously paying to solve that problem? What did they use? How much time does this problem take for them? How important is the problem for them? If they don’t solve it, or it’s solved poorly, what are the consequences? Who else was involved in the decision? ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=830))
    - Functional (i.e., the literal problem the product solves) Emotional (how they will feel if the problem is/is not solved, and how they feel about the new solution) Social (whether they talked to others about the purchase before or after, whether there were any social implications of how the problem was solved) ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=834))
    - Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I recognize this may be a little strange, but this will help me with [work/side project/etc.]. Is it okay if I record this? To start, can you tell me about a product you bought for the first time recently? Where were you when you bought it? Were you with anyone else when you bought it? How did you make the purchase? Before you bought it, was there anything about it that was kind of an open question about it to you? Where did you first learn about the product? What did you do when you first came across [the product]? Did you talk to anyone else before you made the purchase? What were you hoping [the product] would do for you? What other products did you try before this? How did it go when you first used it? Can you tell me about whether it did what you were hoping it would do? Would you buy [this product] again? ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=838))
    - Write out the specific problem hypothesis or question they want answered, ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=896))
    - Kickoff with all relevant stakeholders ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=897))
    - I usually aim for five people, though the real rule is “Stop when you start hearing the same things over and over again.” ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B8QR3WG&location=924))
