    - For software-delivery teams, a team-first approach to cognitive load means limiting the size of the software system that a team is expected to work with; that is, organizations should not allow a software subsystem to grow beyond the cognitive load of the team responsible for the software. This has strong and quite radical implications for the shape and architecture of software systems, as we shall see later in the book.

    - A good platform provides standards, templates, APIs, and well-proven best practices for Dev teams to use to innovate rapidly and effectively. A good platform should make it easy for Dev teams to do the right things in the right way for the organization; this applies to all kinds of product development, not just those involving software.

    - The simplest platform is purely a list on a wiki page of underlying components or services used by consuming software. If those underlying components and services always work reliably, then there is no need for a full-time platform team. However, as the underlying substrate becomes more complicated—even if all components and services are still outsourced—a platform team can provide a valuable management abstraction over the details of the platform, dealing with the coordination of new and deprecated APIs and components. If an organization needs to build custom solutions and integrations into the platform to meet the needs of Dev teams, then the activities of the platform team increase in scope further.

    - A tooling team can easily turn into a siloed tool maintenance team over time if the initial mandate for the team is not specific enough or not time bounded. Besides the emotional attachment to the toolchain, team members’ technical skills can become outdated and their effort wasted in minor improvements led by inertia rather than by real needs.

    - Typically, little thought is given to the viability of the boundaries for teams, resulting in a lack of ownership, disengagement, and a glacially slow rate of delivery. ([Location 2150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=2150))

    - A joined-at-the-database monolith is composed of several applications or services, all coupled to the same database schema, making them difficult to change, test, and deploy separately. ([Location 2182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=2182))

    - need to be alert for the white space between the roles, gaps that nobody feels responsible for. ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NSF94PC&location=2817))
    - A long-lived, high-performing product team should be able to steadily improve their delivery cadence as they find ways to work more efficiently together and remove bottlenecks in delivery. However, a pre-requisite for these teams to flourish is to grant them autonomy over the entire life cycle of the product. This means no hard dependencies on external teams, such as waiting for another team to create new infrastructure. Being able to self-serve new infrastructure via an internal platform is a soft dependency (assuming the provisioning self-service is maintained by a platform team). This level of autonomy is difficult to achieve in many organizations. In fact, it’s common to see the opposite: reducing autonomy by introducing new hard dependencies between teams. It could be an attempt at increasing test coverage by creating a quality assurance (QA) team to centralize testing of all the products and, theoretically, allocate work to testers more efficiently.
