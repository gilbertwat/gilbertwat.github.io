    - If AI is communist, crypto is libertarian. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=68))
    - Another logical implication of falling returns to violence is the eclipse of politics, which is the stage for crime on the largest scale. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=125))
    - This means that provinces and even cities that can effectively uphold property rights and provide for the administration of justice, while consuming few resources, will be viable sovereignties in the Information Age, as they generally have not been during the last five centuries. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=147))
    - The most obvious benefits will flow to the “cognitive elite,” who will increasingly operate outside political boundaries. They are already equally at home in Frankfurt, London, New York, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=151))
    - The ugly, the fat, the old, the disabled will vie with the young and beautiful on equal terms in utterly color-blind anonymity on the new frontiers of cyberspace. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=174))
        - **Note**: CounterargUment is about energy level of each individuals.
    - anyone who thinks clearly will potentially be rich. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=177))
    - At the highest plateau of productivity, these Sovereign Individuals will compete and interact on terms that echo the relations among the gods in Greek myth. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=186))
    - What mythology described as the province of the gods will become a viable option for the individual—a life outside the reach of kings and councils. First in scores, then in hundreds, and ultimately in the millions, individuals will escape the shackles of politics. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=203))
    - This will leave individuals far more responsible for themselves than they have been accustomed to being during the industrial period. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=230))
    - Anyone with a portable computer and a satellite link will be able to conduct almost any information business anywhere, and that includes almost the whole of the world’s multitrillion-dollar financial transactions. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=238))
    - The changes implied by the Information Revolution will not only create a fiscal crisis for governments, they will tend to disintegrate all large structures. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=261))
        - **Note**: Pandemic just slows it down.
    - New technologies will allow the holders of wealth to bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money in the modern period. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=305))
    - As income tax becomes uncollectible, older and more arbitrary methods of exaction will resurface. The ultimate form of withholding tax—de facto or even overt hostage-taking— will be introduced by governments desperate to prevent wealth from escaping beyond their reach. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=316))
        - **Note**: Pandemic is doing this.
    - It is a fact of human nature that radical change of any kind is almost always seen as a dramatic turn for the worse. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=359))
    - The Sovereign Individual of the new millennium will no longer be an asset of the state, a de facto item on the treasury’s balance sheet. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=391))
    - Indeed, they will be more capable of asserting themselves because of far-reaching communications and information warfare capabilities. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=423))
        - **Note**: It is time to build info war capabilities
    - virtual communities gain coherence, they will insist that their members be held accountable according to their own laws, rather than those of the former nation-states in which they happen to reside. Multiple systems of law will again coexist over the same geographic area, as they did in ancient and medieval times. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=429))
        - **Note**: Let try in hk
    - Such march regions developed distinct institutional and legal forms of a kind that we are likely to see again in the next millennium. Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, residents of march regions seldom paid tax. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=448))
    - What is more, they usually had a choice in deciding whose laws they were to obey, a choice that was exercised through such legal concepts as “avowal” and “distraint” that have now all but vanished. We expect such concepts to become a prominent feature of the law of Information Societies. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=450))
    - Such entities will re-emerge in place of the dying nation-state in the new millennium, providing protection and helping to enforce contracts in an unsafe world. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=467))
        - **Note**: How to enforce contracts without force.
    - “The universe rewards us for understanding it and punishes us for not understanding it. When we understand the universe, our plans work and we feel good. Conversely, if we try to fly by jumping off a cliff and flapping our arms the universe will kill us.” ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=480))
    - Often, subtle changes in climate, topography, microbes, and technology alter the logic of violence. They transform the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=489))
    - The challenge to prosperity is precisely that predatory violence does pay well in some circumstances. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=504))
    - To see “outside” an existing system is like being a stagehand trying to force a dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps keep the system functioning. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=931))
        - **Note**: It is why consultancy is working.
    - You cannot depend upon conventional information sources to give you an objective and timely warning about how the world is changing and why. If you wish to understand the great transition now under way, you have little choice but to figure it out for yourself. ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=944))
    - This “make-believe” involved the preservation of the façade of the old system, even as its essence was “deformed by barbarism.”9 The old forms of government remained the same when the last emperor was replaced by a barbarian “lieutenant.” The Senate still met. “The praetorian prefecture and other high offices continued, and were held by eminent Romans.”10 Consuls were still nominated for a year. “The Roman civil administration survived intact.”11 Indeed, in some ways it remained intact until the birth of feudalism at the end of the tenth century. On public occasions, the old imperial insignia was still employed. Christianity was still the state religion. The barbarians still pretended to owe fealty to the Eastern emperor in Constantinople, and to the traditions of Roman law. In fact, in Durant’s words, “in the West the great Empire was no more.” ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=987))
        - **Note**: The greatest learning is, never believe who is tlking, look at who is actually making impact.
    - is simply that it had expanded beyond the scale at which the economies of violence could be maintained. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1008))
    - Taking a longer view, perhaps, the scourge of new “plagues” will compound the challenges of technological devolution in the new millennium. The unprecedented bulge in human population in the twentieth century creates a tempting target for rapidly mutating microparasites. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1017))
        - **Note**: Prophecy fulfilled
    - Corruption, moral decline, and inefficiency appear to be signal features of the final stages of a system. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1116))
    - Both well armed and well motivated, the Greek hoplites were militarily formidable and could not be ignored. Topographic conditions were the foundation of Greek democracy, just as those of a different kind gave rise to the Oriental despotisms of Eygpt and elsewhere. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1159))
    - The transition to agriculture was not a choice of preference, but an improvisation adopted under duress to make up for shortfalls in the diet. ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1174))
    - In the past, governments have been overthrown when crop failures extending over several years raised food prices and shrank disposable incomes. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1184))
    - The declining frequency of eruptions in death rates from the sixteenth century onward helps explain smaller family size and, ultimately, the far lower tolerance of sudden death in war today as compared to the past. This has had the effect of lowering the tolerance for imperialism and raising the costs of projecting power in societies with low birthrates. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1214))
        - **Note**: Make much more sense than the bullshit crypto bros said.
    - Wars of the next millennium will include some almost bloodless battles fought with computers. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1243))
    - If the economic benefits of maintaining a large trading area dwindle, larger governments that previously prospered from exploiting the benefits of encompassing trading areas may begin to break apart—even if the balance of weaponry between offense and defense otherwise remains much as it had been. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1249))
    - That is not to say, of course, that there cannot be deadly eruptions of disease that alter the balance of power. Such episodes have figured prominently in history. The Black Death wiped out large fractions of the population of Eurasia and dealt a crushing blow to the fourteenth-century version of the international economy. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1287))
    - The small scale of foraging bands was advantageous in another way. Members of such small groups would have known one another intimately, a factor that made them more effective in working together. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1363))
    - There was no outlet for investment, not even private property in land, except occasionally in quarries where flint or soapstone was mined. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1392))
        - **Note**: How to relate with nft?
    - There was literally nothing to be gained by working beyond the bare minimum required for survival. ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1402))
    - The idea of property emerged as an inevitable consequence of farming. But the clarity of private property as a concept was attenuated by the logic of violence that also accompanied the introduction of farming. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1453))
    - the closed village joined together to operate like an informal corporation, or a large family, not in an open marketplace but in a closed system where all the economic transactions of the village tended to be struck with a single monopolist—the local landlord, or his agents among the village chiefs. The village as a whole would contract with the landlord, usually for payment in kind, for a high proportion of the crop, rather than a fixed rent. The proportional rent meant that the landlord absorbed part of the downside risk of a bad harvest. Of course, the landlord also took the greater part of the potential profit. Landlords also typically provided seed. This convention also minimized the danger of starvation. It required that the landlord, rather than the peasant, save a disproportionate share ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AK9IXXM&location=1487))
