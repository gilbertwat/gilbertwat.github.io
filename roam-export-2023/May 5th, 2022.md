                - Company wide
                    - No clear aligned KPIs to represent company health and focus other than revenue.
                        - Resolved in the first stage:

                    - Nomad team
                        - Quality of nomad cannot be measured, hence the reward system for nomads are all relied on human intervention.
                            - Coupled with class matching problem
                        - Quality of nomad is not enforceable as the supply is still not stable enough to churn nomads that is not suitable.
