        - The two gods of writing: comprehensiveness and beauty
        - 4 levels of writing: narrative, paragraph, sentence, word
        - Exercise 1 to test my current writing level:
            - Recently, there have been failed attempts to convert the disused container port in Sydney to an answer to Canary Wharf in London. The failed attempts includes a trees lined by the water, high-tech offices and also rooftop gardens in the precinct, with lush playing fields in the vicinity. Unfortunately, things haven't turned out so well for the developers.
        - The narrative
            - How to get through writing block?
                - What is your intent?
                    - persuade, motivate, inspire, entertain
                - Who is your audience?
                    - value, opinion, world view, belief, subject familiarity
                - As specific as possible.
                - Set up the pace, tone and content.
                    - witty, grave, authority, chatty...etc.
            - Example:
                - I want to persuade staff already demoralized due to a badly handled, expensive restructuring to accept pay cuts -- and not think of leaving.
                    - Thank you for putting up with the mess.
                    - Understand we are all demoralized
                    - Future is bright if we pull it through, the vision is not changed.
                    - Strong team and strong will experienced in the past X years.
                    - Necessary steps to keep the boat afloat: pay cut.
                    - Committed to turn the ship around.
                    - Thank you again.
            - Basic unit of writing = points
                - points to move the narratives
            - How to construct your narrative?
                1. collection of points, no need to be structural
                2. Construct the narrative by making order out for chaos
                3. categorizing points
                4. Order the points in a category in a more interesting and elegant way.
                5. Construct a flowing narrative
            - Example:
                - categorize aspects
                - like / don't like
            - Killer Intros
                - Structure first, flare later
                - First place to add flare: Intros
                - Get to the point very fast
                - Aim to start with a bang, anecdotal
                - Create drama, put your audience in the center stage
                    - Example:
                        - Rejoice! The new Mansfield has joined the suffering of life and you are all invited to have a little bit less suffering by taking off this Friday!
                            - Should go for the audience first.
                                - Rejoice, Friday is not your work day! Mr Mansfield says thank you for your support for his new journey as a proud father and recommend you to take the Friday off and do something enjoyable.
            - Cool kicker in the concluding sentence
                - Second place to add flare: conclusion.
                - Unity such as reuse the surprise / flare in intro in the concluding sentences
            - Other types of narrative
                - argumentative: moving forward the argument
            - How to embed imagery
                - Add analogy
                - Metaphor
                - Add flavor to your piece
            - Exercise 1
                - Imagine you‚Äôre a new staff member at a big supermarket.
Twice this week you‚Äôve sent a customer to the wrong aisle,
and both have complained to your manager saying the
shop‚Äôs staff are incompetent. Your manager has a reputation
for loving efficiency and self-reliance. But he hates people
who suck up, and dislikes emotional weakness of any kind.
He has asked for a written explanation of your actions, and
threatened serious consequences if it falls short. You badly
want to keep the job, but you need to explain that you‚Äôve
been dealing with some major personal problems that you
don‚Äôt wish to discuss that have distracted you from your
work.
                - Write the brief letter with the appropriate tone and content
to perfectly match your audience. Try also to make it
elegant.
                - Narrative
                    - Acknowledge the consequence of complaints
                    - Managing my personal matters at best not to intervene with professional matter
                    - Promise never to do it again.
                    - Reassure you can solve that independently and maintain efficiency
                    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Work on expanding a new tone of force and authority in my #writings üëèüèº finished on [[April 5th, 2023]]
            - Symmetry of narrative
                - I, we, one we need to be controlled.
                - Don't, Don't, Dont .... OR Do, Do, Do.
            - How to extend the narrative
                - Elaborate
                - Illustrate
            - Lose perspective
                - Get a fresh view
                    - change the font size
                    - Read aloud
                    - print out
        - The paragraph
            - Why
                - Build drama
                - Steer the reader
                - Give visual cues 
            - Different style
                - tabloid style: short
                - wsj style 
            - paragraph is a unit of attention
            - avoid Superthick paragraph
        - The sentence
            -
