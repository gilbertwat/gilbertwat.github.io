    - They don’t get to the definition of intelligence: learning fast. Now that we know more about what’s possible with AI, we can settle on a vocabulary. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=262))
    - The steps to building a data learning effect with intelligent machines are (1) capturing a critical mass of data, (2) developing capabilities to process that data into information, and (3) feeding that information into a computer that runs calculations over data to learn something new. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=285))
    - Economies of scale to data: there is lots of data going across the Internet, captured from the sensors on personal and industrial devices; Data processing capabilities: very powerful computers that can run calculations over this data, at a reasonable cost, and capable people who can make connections between disparate datasets; and Data network effects: researchers found ways to organize data into networks that run calculations on one part of the network, send the result to another part of the network for more calculations, and come up with new information. This is the field of neural networks or, more broadly, intelligent systems. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=313))
    - Not all data contains information; if data cannot be used to change someone’s mind—to resolve uncertainty—it’s not information. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=359))
    - DLEs combine three types of competitive advantage: scale, processing capabilities, and network effects. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=384))
    - The distinction between a product with network effects and one without is that the product is more useful because of the network effect. The distinction between a normal network and a data network is that data networks transmit derivatives of data—information—not just data itself. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=399))
    - Economies of scale happen when cost decreases, on a marginal basis, as production increases. Variety is customer demand for lots of different features or products. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=500))
    - Further, customers of AI-First products inherently have a high demand for variety because each customer needs a model that can make predictions specific to their business. DLEs thus tip markets in favor of one winner. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=515))
    - One product that gets better in the foreground thanks to DLEs is Square Capital, the division of Square that lends money to customers of the company’s point-of-sale (POS) systems (their cash registers). ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=524))
    - The initial cost of making products with DLEs amortizes over each additional customer. Building intelligent systems is expensive: buying, collecting, cleaning, and storing data. Hiring data scientists and ML engineers is also expensive. Usually a company has to spend a lot of money before customers see value in the predictions. However, expenses reduce once customers start using the product and contributing data. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=565))
    - The promise of AI is that it helps to make better, faster decisions. How much AI customers need depends on the types of decisions they’re making and the data on which they’re basing those decisions. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=707))
    - Go through this decision tree and weigh the two buckets: AI and analytics. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=713))
    - Data engineering includes instrumenting data sources to consistently collect good data, building infrastructure in which to store that data, extracting data from existing data stores, transforming data that doesn’t match the structure of existing data, and making it easy to load data into different databases. Data science encompasses detecting anomalies, setting up analytical processes to run on the data at regular intervals, segmenting data, aggregating datasets to put data into context, and figuring out which features of an algorithm might predict something useful. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=718))
    - Dedicate a data scientist to serve as a consultant to customers and provide personalized, data-driven answers to a single question in order to demonstrate return on investment (ROI). Let’s contrast this approach with answering multiple questions at once using ML. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=754))
    - Rather, it’s time to prove value as a company that can build real working AIs. Later on, when it’s necessary for AIs to use data from all over the organization, construct a data lake, adopt a metadata management process, test ETL (extract, transform, and load) products that automate some of the data processing steps, manually (re-)label data, hire data stewards to ensure compliance with data labeling standards, or implement any number of best practices advocated by large consulting firms and data product vendors. The first job is to provide a useful prediction. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=811))
    - Starting small increases buyer engagement because it means working with one stakeholder at a time to answer her most pressing question. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=817))
    - Starting small, with a single question about data in one dataset, reduces the need to wrestle with poor data from multiple databases. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=821))
    - Starting small means delivering predictions to teams in a way that’s easy for them to consume. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=825))
    - Running a successful POC requires setting clear expectations around accuracy, timeline, and cost. Briefly, here are the elements of a good POC. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=837))
    - The process above, called Lean AI, is intended to build a small but complete AI to solve a specific problem. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=857))
    - There’s one more step to Lean AI that’s just beyond the statistics work above: developing the first models. This usually starts with running simple algorithms over some customer data to generate a prediction, even if it is low accuracy, or below the PUT. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=921))
    - Messing about with ML frameworks for months may mean never getting a product out the door. Taking a step back, one straightforward approach that I’ve seen work well is to speak to potential customers and distill what they say into a few problems to solve with statistics. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=933))
    - With Lean AI, anyone can get started on the path to building an AI-First company. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=946))
    - Data that is hard to obtain might be hard for others to get, too. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=995))
    - The time it takes to pull data from a given system presents a barrier to others. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1001))
    - The price charged by data vendors is an obvious barrier. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1008))
    - The time it takes to collect data can give a head start over competitors that may want to collect that same data. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1017))
    - The rate at which data perishes determines relevance. Old data may no longer represent reality and thus can cause models to generate an invalid prediction. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1028))
    - The veracity of data determines reliability in the context of making a decision. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1038))
    - The number of dimensions in the data determines whether it’s relevant to making a decision. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1042))
    - The breadth of data determines how closely it represents reality. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1047))
    - Self-reinforcing data becomes more valuable over time. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1052))
    - However, models to recognize specific clauses in a legal contract can be trained on a hundred Word documents. And these numbers will change in the months after you read this book, ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1062))
    - AI-First companies get ahead of potential compliance concerns by making it clear from the outset of negotiations that their main interest is in learning from data and the data exhaust, such as user engagement and interaction data, metadata, and data flow information. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1095))
    - Data integrators build a valuable data asset by directly collecting data that flows through their pipeline or by generating metadata based on usage patterns, derivations, or other observations. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1191))
    - Over time, the economic value of a particular data labeling operation can be quantified in terms of money saved by automation over the cost of each label, multiplied by the number of labels required to get the model to that level of automation. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1283))
    - One benefit of developing an IML system is that asking for user input builds trust. Allowing users to “correct” the output of a system and then see that their corrections affected the system’s next output promotes trust in a number of ways. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1335))
    - Setting up a team to label data can be a core process advantage for an AI-First company. Before assembling a team, however, consider the large, platform-based solutions for labeling such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1341))
    - Harvesting data from consumers for one reason then selling it to corporations for a different reason is common and can be the basis of a big business. ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1537))
    - Every week, I seem to hear about yet another novel way to acquire data. The creativity around simply obtaining data is remarkable, let alone the creativity involved in building the next wave of tools for society. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1680))
    - Data analyst: set up dashboards, visualize data, and interpret model outputs. Data scientist: set up and run experiments. Data engineer: clean data, create automated data management tools, maintain the data catalogue, consolidate data assets, incorporate new data sources, maintain data pipelines, and set up links to external data sources. Machine learning engineer: implement, train, monitor, and fix ML models. Data product manager: incorporate the data needs of the model with the usability intentions of the product designers and preferences of customers in order to prioritize product features that collect proprietary data. Data infrastructure engineer: choose the right database, set up databases, move data between databases, manage infrastructure cost, and more. Machine learning researcher: set up and run experiments. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1743))
    - Software engineer: write the software that delivers the predictions through an interface, application programming interface, API, or other medium. Designer: design the interfaces, including any interactive elements that get feedback data from customers. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1752))
    - Data analyst: first, because the business need for improving decision-making informs the prioritization of predictive modeling projects. Data scientist: second, because trying to make predictions with statistical and ML methods provides the initial evidence to support further investment in specific sources of data and types of models. Data engineer: third, because getting and processing data comes before building models. Machine learning engineer: fourth, because building a model that works in the real world requires robust modeling and integration with existing software. Data product manager: fifth, because designing a product to get feedback on the model’s output aids improvement and accumulates proprietary feedback data. Data infrastructure engineer: sixth, because scaling the working models requires managing large volumes of data, processing it fast, and ensuring quality. Machine learning researcher: seventh, because finding solutions to edge cases demands going beyond readily available ML frameworks to push the state of the art forward. ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1769))
    - Statistics. Measurement, process control, instrumentation, and modeling. Manipulation. Modeling, clustering, regression, simulation, and visualization. Operations. Optimization, yield management, manufacturing engineering, systems, dynamics, forecasting, and decision-making. Learning. Signal processing, control engineering, statistical mechanics, systems, and many more. ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=1829))
    - One way to think about a product’s value to a customer is to model the shape of the payoff from using that product. These payoffs are usually in the shape of a curve—convex or concave. ([Location 2657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2657))
    - Convex payoffs represent an increase in value with use. ([Location 2661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2661))
    - This seems a little abstract, but it is remarkably useful when thinking about where to apply ML—in other words, when the expected value of using the product exceeds the cost. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2670))
    - This means that getting output requires some data. Products without enough data to get a DLE in motion won’t provide enough value to customers to encourage them to contribute more data and keep the DLE going. ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2700))
    - Feedback data changes the system, hopefully so that it can make better predictions. This is the most proprietary data. Design products to constantly collect feedback data; for example, ask customers if the prediction was right, to correct it, or to just accept it. ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2711))
    - However, as seen in the core DLE formulas, data can have limited utility beyond a certain point. ([Location 2716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2716))
    - New entrants leveraging algorithmic breakthroughs that achieve the same level of output with less data can leapfrog incumbents. ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2726))
    - Once the product yields diminishing returns, companies deliver more value to customers by gathering data to solve adjacent problems. ([Location 2731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2731))
    - Models drift if the data used to train them no longer lines up with the real world. Models trained on highly perishable data might seem to favor new entrants, but, in practice, incumbents with widely deployed systems may have the best access to fresh data in high volume. ([Location 2733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2733))
    - Set a threshold and deem the model to be right when it outputs a positive above a certain threshold—for example, above that 90 percent. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2791))
    - receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows how well the model performed at different thresholds. ([Location 2793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2793))
    - Calculate the area under the curve (AUC) by integrating this curve. This is the shaded part. This area gives an aggregate measure of how accurate the model was across all the different thresholds. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2802))
    - Precision and recall measure how effectively the model retrieves and identifies relevant results. ([Location 2807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2807))
    - Loss is the quantum of how right or wrong the model was in making a given prediction. ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2817))
    - products can include explicit ways for customers to provide feedback on decisions—implicitly accepting or rejecting the prediction behind that decision. ([Location 2829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2829))
    - Let’s not forget the basics here: the easiest way to tell if customers derive value from the product is to see how much they’re using it. ([Location 2834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2834))
    - The other way to think of this is from the customer-acquisition perspective: greater prediction accuracy can lead to more automation, attracting more customers or encouraging existing customers to use the product more, thus generating more data, leading to better predictions, and so on. ([Location 2852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2852))
    - Vertical products apply ML to commercial or industrial data to generate a prediction of value to their customers. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2855))
    - Horizontal products include tools for ML engineers and data scientists across different verticals. ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2859))
    - The first way to think about measuring profitability is on a unit basis. Unit analysis is simply that: picking a unit and analyzing its profitability. ([Location 2888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2888))
        - **Note**: The unit can be creative.
    - The goal is to increase the unit’s gross profit. ([Location 2906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2906))
    - The cost of building software that could be used by all potential customers is often considered to be R & D rather than a cost of goods sold (COGS), and some large, established companies allocate 25 percent of their capital to R & D. Classifying expenses as R & D rather than COGS affects net and gross profits, respectively. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2940))
    - Moats are the wrong metaphor. Moats are an accumulation of assets that form a barrier, but barriers can be broken down and those assets taken away from you. DLEs accumulate not only data assets but also lessons. ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=2974))
    - Today methods such as one-shot learning, generative adversarial networks, and probabilistic programming are good for getting models to a high degree of accuracy with relatively little data. Scale isn’t enough. Combining scale of data, processing capabilities, and network effects to build a DLE is the way forward, and building all three may involve vertical integration. ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3061))
    - The volume of data and predictions is the basis of value for AI-First products. Pricing based on data and prediction volume can allow for growth because volume isn’t limited by usage. ([Location 3195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3195))
    - new entrants can appropriate customers from incumbent suppliers by selling a specialized product to a niche segment of customers at a fraction of the cost of the incumbent’s product. ([Location 3214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3214))
    - The core assumptions here are that it’s possible to identify customers that don’t need all the features of the incumbent’s product and to produce a more specialized, higher-quality product that costs significantly less. ([Location 3216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3216))
    - The large amount of data flowing freely around the world creates an opportunity: aggregate that data, curate it with intelligent systems, distribute it widely to generate more data, and so on. ([Location 3242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3242))
    - Standards, as communicated through documentation and training, give protocol, data, product, personnel, and process lock-in. ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3310))
    - The question of when and how to pursue standardization to get customer lock-in is perhaps one of the most important when setting a technology company’s product and marketing strategies. ([Location 3333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3333))
    - Companies creating a new market generally promote standardization so that their technology is adopted widely. ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3335))
    - Dominant companies in mature markets tend to demote standardization, promote fragmentation, or enforce a highly detailed standard to reduce competition from new entrants. ([Location 3342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3342))
    - Considering when to execute on standardization initiatives involves recognizing who has leverage in a given market. ([Location 3350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3350))
    - Compatibility—introducing a new product that works with the products customers already use—is an important consideration for AI-First companies needing data from other applications in order to train underlying models. ([Location 3375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3375))
    - Investing in complementary products, either by building them or having an ecosystem of developers build them, increases the customer value. ([Location 3394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3394))
    - Consumers buy into brands that they trust and like. Brands build trust through consistency and are liked for their usability. They do this through personalization. ([Location 3430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3430))
    - Many domains are devoid of truly intelligent workflow applications. That is, intelligent applications that run ML algorithms over a combination of rich input data, exhaust data, and external data to make predictions, or, ideally, decisions for the customers. ([Location 3502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3502))
    - You don’t start by building technology; you start by building understanding. ([Location 3525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVSH7XZ&location=3525))
