        - Assumption and hypothesis
            - COVID will further accelerate the growth of e-commerce in SE Asia
                - E-commerce platforms will be more fragmented in the next 10 year
                - The demand and expectation of e-commerce logistics will keep increasing
            - 3PL is a downward spiral in prices
                - Need to shift our positioning from a cost center to a revenue driver
            - Keep doing what we are doing won’t take us far (e.g. resources, stages)
                - e.g. LLM, NinjaVan, e-commerce’s logistics team...etc
            - [Move toward an omnichannel experience](https://www.xsellco.com/resources/ecommerce-customer-experience/)
                - eCommerce sellers who provide buying options across websites, social media, third-party marketplaces and physical retail stores offer the best customer experience
            - E-commerce merchants will use a portfolio approach to reduce costs and increase reach
            - We won’t have enough capital to build a customer facing brand
                - We are not an everyday utility app like Grab
                - We have very few traffic outside of HK
            - Cross-border e-commerce is the future
                - “We saw significant growth with our merchants looking to expand internationally and in Q1 2019, international growth was our fastest-growing customer segment, with total merchant sales (GMV) from international nearly doubling”  - Shopify
