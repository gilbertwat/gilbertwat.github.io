    - Let's write in our language.
        - There must be more than 2 people, let's call them Ar Keung and Ar Sit.
        - Ar Keung and Ar Sit both have something that the other party want.
            - Let's say Ar Keung, the hunter, need to craft a bow to hunt and he needs lumber.
            - And Ar Sit, the lumberjack, need to mend her clothes and she needs fur to do so.
        - and they exchanged.
        - In that exchange, both of the parties are able to do something more, had they not do the exchange.
        - But how about money?
            - Money is just a way for receiver to be able to defer or transact the value to another party(ies).
                - Read [[The nature of money]]

        - So all in all we established:
            - Business is about exchange X that you have for Y so that all parties in the exchange has advanced towards achieving their goals.
        - So what is [[[[product]] development]]?
            - As YCombinator:
                - make things people want.
                    - It takes me a whole decade for me to truly understand the meaning.
                    - Two parts:
                        - Make things
                        - Figure out what people want.
                        - And those two can be intertwined.
                        - Make an MVP to figure out what people want.
            - Again the stories of Ar Keung and Ar Sit.
                - Ar Keung is hurt and no longer able to hunt.
                    - But he found out his bow and arrow is more effective than the bow of other hunter's, when he is talking to other hunters in the bar.
                    - He then tried to sell the bows he made to the hunter's in other villages.
                    - After a few roadshows and demo, 10 hunters bought them and really enjoy the bows and arrows, they are able to hunt more effectively, has less maintenance work.
                    - He experimented with other lumbers but he only able to keep the quality using Ar Ming's lumber.
                    - He strike a deal with Ar Ming to be the exclusive lumber provider for him.
                    - Ar Ming is working **for** Ar Keung to provide him the lumber now.
                    - 
            - So we had a conclusion
                - Product development is about building something that a lot of people want it and make a cut in the process.
        - What is common between [[[[product]] development]] and [[business]]?
        - All in all [[[[product]] development]] is a more complex [[business]].
        - Or in other words there are multiple ways to [[business]], [[[[product]] development]] is just one of the way to do it.
