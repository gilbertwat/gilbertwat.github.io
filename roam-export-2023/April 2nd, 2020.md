- [[Epidemics II from HKUx]]
    - Case definition
        - Subclinical + Asymptotic
    - What is Epidemic
        - > Expected cases in community
            - Example: Smallpox: Expected = 0
        - Arupt and significant increase of cases compare with normal
    - Epicurve
        - Day again Number of new cases
        - Stratification of it can find out a lot of insight
        - Size
        - Distribution
    - Incubation
        - point source (Food poisioning)
            - 1 peak
        - Propagated 
            - multiple peaks
            - larger and larger
    - Incubation
        - Dosage
        - Genetic, Age, complication in immune
        - pharamalogical
        - Right skewed
        - Log scale of incubation = normal distribution
        - clinical management
        - public health control
            - Quarantine
                - Isolation from community
                - 90% percentile
                - surveillance
        - Backcalculation
            - How many are their infection
            - COVID-19? #Homework

    - Transmissibility
        - Attack rate = number of infection / exposed population
        - Secondary attack rate
            - Semi-closed setting 
        - Reproductive number
            - R0 = Basic Reproductive number
            - Expected 1 cases to transmiss to number of person
                - exponential
        - Example:
            - Recover = immune
            - 
        - Final Attack rate
            - close to end of epidemic
        - Triangle
            - Pathogen X Host X Environment
    - Timescale
        - Generation time
            - Impossible to precisely
            - Serial interval = Symptons onset of successive cases
        - Shorter => quicker to isolation
        - Latent period = non transmissible
        - Infectious period = transmissible
        - Epidemic growth rate
        - Epidemic Double time
    - Severity
        - Case fatality risk
            - Case = Hospitalized + Lab tested + Medically attended
        - Host factors: Age, Genetic, Socioeconomic, comorbidities
        - pathogen
        - Environmental factor
        - Difficulties of robust estimation
            - Real-time estimation
            - Method of estimation 
                - Censoring effect
                    - Still hospitalized
                    - Disregard hospitalized
                - Duration of hospitalized
                - More sophisticated method to make use of current data
