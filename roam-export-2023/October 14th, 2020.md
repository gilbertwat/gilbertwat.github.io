- [[360 Review]] [[Paul Leung]]
    - What's one thing this person should stop doing?
        - I have tons but I need to highlight that he should stop requiring total control and alignment from all agile teams on a certain process. Process is helping us to ship product and debug delivery problems. They should be changeable according to circumstances and as lightweight as possible. Each agile team has its own customer segments and team dynamics, hence we need our process to be flexible. We can solve release management problem by treating our process as building blocks and decoupling systems.
    - What's one thing this person should start doing?
        - I have tons but I would emphasize on understanding current team situation. Also keep himself up-to-date with the best practices in an increasingly complex system. The approach of assuring quality in an established, slow pace organization with a simple product is different from what [[GOGOX]] need right now.

- [[360 Review]] [[Gemmy Wong]]
    - What's one thing this person should stop doing?
        - Focusing on the ideals and gaps between them, instead we should focus on the steps necessary to bridge the gaps and create a feedback loop to iterate. For example, we are not happy with the work quality of department X, and their work is affecting our company. What should be our next step? How to measure success? Can we root cause fix it? If not, how are we minimizing its impact to the company?
    - What's one thing this person should start doing?
        - Put more effort on articulating design efforts, taste and concepts to non-designers to expand her influence
    - What's one thing this person should continue doing?
        - Keeping the good vibe and standard of work to set up a good example for designers around the company
- [[360 Review]] [[Ben Lin]]
    - What's one thing this person should stop doing?
        - Prioritize execution of tasks instead of communicating and updating project status. Platform team members are supposed to be the best partner of infrastructure team, but currently we are not sharing enough context to be even more impactful and communication cruft is coming up from time to time.
    - What's one thing this person should start doing?
        - Influence our infrastructure teammates to be more aware of the business and product and be relentless in seeking feedback from users such as platform team members.
    - What's one thing this person should continue doing?
        - Be calm, rational and confident to himself.
- [[360 Review]] [[Patrick Leung]]
    - What's one thing this person should stop doing?
        - Very stressed out by the seemingly under-performance of data team members
    - What's one thing this person should start doing?
        - Rallying the team together to support new data manager.
    - What's one thing this person should continue doing?
        - Understand business deeply by talking to everyone of the department head.
