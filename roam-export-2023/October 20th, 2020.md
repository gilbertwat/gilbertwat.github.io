    - Excerpt
        - Great questions spring from less-great questions which spring from “bad” questions. It takes time and multiple cycles of divergence and convergence to come up with the highest impact questions.
        - When it comes to being “data informed”, people generally have one of three related needs:
            - I need to make a decision, and I need data to inform that decision.
            - I want to reduce uncertainty related to an assumption.
            - I want to understand performance and impact. I want to know if something is working. I want to prove something is working (or not working) or will work (or will not work).
        - The table has three columns: one for decisions, one for assumptions, and one for areas of performance and impact. For each column I give sample questions/assumptions along a spectrum of specificity.
        - Broad --> Specific
        - why, who, what, when, where, which, how many, how, how long, do, are, will, have, should, and is.
        - **Good questions guide the way.** Once you’ve prioritized important questions, the next step is to ask “what can we measure to reduce uncertainty related to this question?”
    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Takeaways
        - A good leader is guiding the team to solve problems.
        - Problems can come from different granularity.
        - Solution of the same problem can come from another granularity
        - Decision is where and how we move forward.
        - Assumption is where we could fail in gauging the reality.
        - Impact is where we could gain if it works out.
