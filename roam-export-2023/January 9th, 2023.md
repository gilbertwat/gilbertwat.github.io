    - Try to fight for [[Anna Yu]] and [[Moses Ngan]] for salary raise with [[Tommie Lo]] 
        - Hey good evening 

Tommie and Vegas,Just wanna raise my concerns on giving Momo and Anna a raise on the lower bracket. I learned from Vegas earlier in this evening. 

Assume they will share the knowledge of of salary increase, we will risk losing our key contributors to our current delivery and further slow us down. But If we give an average raise bundle and reiterating some expectation growth with them, I think we can strike a win win.

I do express they still have quite a reservation with the company so I understand our reservations on giving them more, but the current situation is very delicate and our expected delay of delivery without them will be long.

Please do consider that in our final decision in their annual salary review.
