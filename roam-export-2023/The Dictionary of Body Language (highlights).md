    - —Playing with our hair (twirling, twisting, stroking) is a pacifying behavior. It is most frequently utilized by women and might indicate either a good mood (while reading or relaxing) or stress (when waiting for an interview, for example, or experiencing a bumpy flight). Note that when the palm of the hand faces the head it is more likely to be a pacifier, as opposed to the palm-out orientation discussed below.

    - —Uptalk is when people inflect their tone up at the end of a declarative sentence, as though it were a question. Studies show that even a single instance of uptalk on the phone can negatively impact the listener’s impression of the speaker. Though uptalk is popular with many young people, it makes them sound tentative and lacking in confidence. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075JDX981&location=613))
    - A formal inquiry may also cause us to delay answering because of the seriousness of the hearing. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075JDX981&location=625))
