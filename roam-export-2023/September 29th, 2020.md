- [[Praise]] from [[Alia Bei]]
    - #[[üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Self Awareness]]
    - Although this praise is long overdue, a praise has to go on record. I‚Äôve received feedback from multiple sources that your team management skills have improved vastly. I personally agree with those feedback as well, the level of maturity when talking about your team and progress have turned 180 degrees when compared to a year ago.
        - Your level of self-awareness ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
        - Level of stress managing deliver team ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
        - You‚Äôve proven capable of leading mature team leads and retaining them
        - Although you are still working on articulating your thoughts at 
- times, you have proven capable of identifying your teams‚Äô strengths and 
- weaknesses.
    - In order to continue to move up I strongly urge you to work on 
- managing conflict (face problems immediately and get them out of the 
- way) and gaining track record in building a stronger team by raising 
- their level of self-awareness and how they should play their strength.
