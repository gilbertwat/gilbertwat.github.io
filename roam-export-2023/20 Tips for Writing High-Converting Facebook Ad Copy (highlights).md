If they are still with you after this, it’s time to show them WHY they should buy from you over someone else. This is where shipping times, offers, payment options, or even really positive reviews have time to shine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb8zfcxyee8m3trxc3m5xx2x))

    - •   **Cost per click (CPC):** How much are you paying for each click from your ad campaign? CPC is one of the most commonly tracked metrics, and for good reason, as if this is high, it’s more likely your overall return on investment will be lower.
•   **Cost per thousand impressions (CPM):** If your ad impressions are low, it’s a good bet everything else (CPC, overall costs, etc.) will be higher. Also, if your impressions are low, your targeting could be too narrow. Either way, it’s important to track and make adjustments when needed.
•   **Ad frequency:** How often are people seeing your ads in their news feed? Again, this could signal larger issues with targeting, competition, ad quality, and more. So keep a close eye on it.
•   **Impressions:** A high number of impressions indicates that your ad is well optimized for the platform and your audience.
•   **Amount spent:** Tracking the estimated amount of money you’ve spent on your campaigns, ad set or individual ad will show you if you staying within your budget and which campaigns are the most cost-effective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdj9x7z4gsk5pzme75sh8rdw))
