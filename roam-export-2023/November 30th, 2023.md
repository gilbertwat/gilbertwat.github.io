            - [https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-manage-switching-programming-languages?contributionUrn=urn:li:comment:(articleSegment:(urn:li:linkedInArticle:7100528897120755712,7100528899385663489),7135908298721021952)&trk=rtyc]
            - The first time when I switch my programming language from Java to Javascript was the last phase of interview where I have to contribute for a week (paid of course). I was in Meteor.JS and both the language(Java vs Javascript) and the paradigm(OOP vs Event based) was alien to me. I was able to contribute meaningfully by shipping a feature and managed to secure the job offer.

Since then I believe in 3 things, total immersion, problem based curriculum AND solid understanding of fundamentals can enable you to thrive in any programming language.

Be confident!
