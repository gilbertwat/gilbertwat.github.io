        - We have a traditional customers
            - Driver
            - SMB owners
            - Large Corporate
            - Individual
        - To serve them we need to build something very concrete to validate our ideas.
        - This need a higher engineering cost
            - PoC tends to be rushed and non-architected
            - if the PoC works we need to rebuild it in a scalable fashion (our traditional customer will be less tolerated to defects and perf issues)But because of limited engineering cost, we stop in the PoC phase ðŸ˜… and ship that to product ion and expect engineers can iterate on it
        - We cannot satisfy our engineers', product's and customers' need
