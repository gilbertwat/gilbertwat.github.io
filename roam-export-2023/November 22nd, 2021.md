    - Excerpts from the article and some scribble
        - We were promoting the videos on several websites/forums to get the first views rolling.
        - Eventually, after promoting the videos, we stopped for a while with the project. We wanted to see if the videos were picked up by people. It didn‚Äôt get much attraction at the beginning, even after all the promotion we did, so we thought ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt work‚Äù.
        - It concatenates all videos that were located in a particular directory. To do this quickly, I used a Python library called ‚Äú[[MoviePy]]‚Äù.
        - I quickly designed a logo for the YouTube channel and a frame used for the compilations centered around the recorded video, which you usually see in these types of videos. When I finished the design work, I made an outro using Photoshop and Sony Vegas, it was just a simple end-screen showcasing 2 other related videos while playing music.
        - So why was the outro 30 seconds? What does it have to do with monetization? Here comes the interesting part about how you can monetize a compilation channel. It is known that you can‚Äôt monetize your channel if you upload compilations because the content is not original. Also, the videos that appear in the compilations are using (sometimes) copyrighted songs, especially in TikTok videos. This causes your video to be copyrighted by YouTube and prevents you from earning money with your videos. When we were constantly bombarded with copyright claims because of the songs that were played in the videos, we came up with an idea.

    - Excerpts from the article and some scribble
        - __"Ford was able to significantly improve their quality by tasking managers with simply asking workers "how can this be done better?", listening to what they had to say and then supporting new, practical improvements to the manufacturing process. The prior approach was for the manager to think up improvements in abstraction - usually their boss's ideas - and push those ideas onto the workers. Today, this top down anti-pattern is repeated in management of software teams."__
        - Now, back to those¬†__'devs need to do better'__¬†articles popping up all over the internet. Let's imagine if those articles were written for auto workers. I can see the titles now:
            - American auto workers really need to focus on improving their manufacturing process, that's what Toyota did!
            - Auto workers should be iterating with the customer so they can build the best car possible
            - Auto workers spend too much time on the details, and not enough time understanding the "why"
            - Crafting great automobiles isn't just about building cars
        - The advent of Date Scrum has driven many developers to be very negative about Agile practices, they come by this honestly as before going 'Agile' they had to put up with a status meeting every couple weeks. Now with Date Scrum they have to put up with a status meeting every day at the stand-up!
        - So, we need more articles that encourage the C-Suite, and management in general, to stop causing failed software projects. Articles that call out traditional management for being completely out of their lane with their detailed estimates, Gantt charts, WBS, PMP and all the rest of the manufacturing/order fulfillment/logistics optimization techniques. That stuff is great, it was key to helping us win WW2, and if I ever run a factory, I'm gonna use it! But it has no place in software projects.
        - Devs that take a reasonable amount of extra time to check their work and remove the chaos are characterized as 'kinda slow'

        - Devs who implement features quickly so that another silo can check them for 'quality' are appreciated because they are getting to Done‚Ñ¢ quickly
        - Devs that wander into the field and notice that customers are really struggling to use the product are carefully steered back to the Idea Silo's agenda
        - Dev Managers that try and understand the Big Picture of product/market fit, packaging, and pricing are patted on the head and sent back to focus the dev team on implementing the scoped features that no customer wants

        - When might an alternative be a better fit than Agile Scrum? For example, when a team is new, they may lack maturity. Perhaps pairing new team members with mature team members and leveraging pair programming for a while is the right solution.
        - Or, when customers are too busy to iterate with the development team, perhaps leveraging RAD and doing market studies using MVPs, and Steve Blank‚Äôs customer development is the solution.
        - Or, when the problem isn‚Äôt a customer need, but is actually a technical challenge. Perhaps leveraging prototyping, running lots of experiments and using the scientific method is the answer.
        - Or, when the solution is a piece of new hardware based on a known reference design where the constraint is the logistics of manufacturing. Then perhaps prototyping, followed by a waterfall pattern as applied to hardware development is the solution. Yes waterfall, as in you gather all of the requirements for the new hardware up front and you thoroughly test the resulting product on the backend of the process. You know, waterfall, the thing that all the agile salesmen say doesn‚Äôt work.
        - Or, when the team is doing something that has never been done before in response to an emerging problem. This situation is when something like lean programming can really shine, when the team must be the ones that discover the solution (Gemba), using amplified learning and experimentation.
        - The point is: one size does not fit all. And, though Agile Scrum can be crazy good, there are many cases where it doesn‚Äôt work well. To just blindly apply Agile Scrum to all situations is stupid. It‚Äôs like having an orchestra with only one instrument; sure, you can do that, but why? It‚Äôs like having a project methodology that believes it wraps all things, even things unknown. It‚Äôs like having a bikini that thinks it can fit all sizes and occasions.
