- [[1:1]] with [[Ben Cheng]] discussion about [[event sourcing]] and [[System Design]]. #Microservices
    - Currently we have 3 microservices
        - [[[[GOGOX]] Partner Wallet]]
        - [[[[GOGOX]] delivery-platform]]
        - [[[[GOGOX]] gogovan-server]]
    - When we complete our orders in [[[[GOGOX]] delivery-platform]] or [[[[GOGOX]] gogovan-server]], we emit an event `OrderCompleted` from those services
    - Currently we also emit another even `PartnerSubsidyAdded` from almost the same routine
    - [[[[GOGOX]] Partner Wallet]] will consume both through different topic but different consumer groups for processing.
    - As they are in different consumer groups, the order of event is not guarantee and it can be consumed at the same time.
    - If one of them is processing when another need to process, it will result in [[Optimistic Locking]] of the wallet, which can be fixed in both ways:
        - A. Rescue if there is optimistic locking on the parter wallet side.
        - B. Redesign the `PartnerSubsidyAdded` to `OrderSubsidyAdded` and new event with use the same topic and consumer group of `OrderCompleted` to guarantee ordering within the same partition.
        - C. Remove `PartnerSubsidyAdded` and calculate the subsidy on the producer side.
    - We have chosen the B. way as it will make the events make more sense and avoid the problem for now, with a possibility of moving to C. later.
    - There are 2 [[ü§î Questions]] from architectural perspective:
        - What if there is really a business case we need to do 2 commands from 2 topics? optimistic locking will be a possibility? How to resolve that?
        - How to discuss and record the discussion and rationale of this kind of design?
- [[holding people accountable]] is something very tough for me. I think underlying psychology is that I don't trust people and I don't trust myself. Lack of confidence to be vulnerable and failure in trusting people. How can I improve this? #[[üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Self Awareness]] #[[ü§î Questions]] #[[‚òùüèª Leadership]]
