- [[May 22nd, 2022]] and [[May 22nd, 2021]] [[May 22nd, 2020]] review
    - Woah I attach my self-worth to some communities two years ago.
        - No wonder I was in such a bad state
            - #learning never attach your self-worth to communities that you are not contributing. it is just some external people, perception from some other people which I don't have any controls.
    - And I am a bit grumpy from the word I put down.
    - Woah it is a really hard 2020 seems very harsh
