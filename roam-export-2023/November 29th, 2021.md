    - Why are you reading this?
        - I don't want me to step on the same problem again [[risk]]
        - Board [[management]] is also a type of [[management]] in [[Managing up]].
    - Excerpts from the article and some scribble
        - Let‚Äôs say you want some help from an investor who is not on the board. What do you do? You call them and they help you.
        - Founders have many reasons they start companies, but investors really have only one reason they back them: to make money. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called investors. If someone gives you money based on the things you told them you were going to do, they are going to want to sit down with you every month or two to see if you are doing those things.
        - Boards firing the CEO happens quite often, especially as a company gets larger and more valuable. As Feld and Ramsinghani point out, ‚Äúby the time the ventures were three years old, 50% of the founders were no longer the CEO.‚Äù
        - Add to this that if a new CEO is hired, they will probably want to be surrounded by their own people and may view the previous CEO‚Äôs lieutenants as suspect if the parting was acrimonious, so many of the existing management team will also go. This means a substantial new round of option grants, diluting the founders and early investors.
        - First, and this isn‚Äôt part of the advice because it goes without saying, is don‚Äôt be an asshole. Don‚Äôt cheat, don‚Äôt steal, don‚Äôt lie, don‚Äôt treat people badly.
        - Third, in cases where common controls the board, investor directors can cajole the non-CEO common seats to vote against the CEO.
        - First, don‚Äôt give them reason to discuss you without you. Get them to discuss you¬†__with__¬†you. And do it one on one.
        - If board members are going to be meeting outside the board meeting, be there. If some of them are flying into town the night before an 8am board meeting, don‚Äôt be too busy to go to dinner with them.
        - There are two parts to this: do not surprise your board members, and do not invite your board members to surprise you.
        - And when you do, do it on the phone and one board member at a time. Tell them the news, tell them what you think the company should do about it, and then listen to what they have to say.
        - You do not need to mention to the board that you contacted each of them and pre-told them the information they are hearing again for the second time.
        - Inviting them to freestyle in the meeting has the possibility of starting a downward spiral: one board member says something you should have done or should do and the others start to chip in until it becomes a pile-on.
        - Just to reiterate. Board members show up at meetings to monitor their investment and decide if they still want you to be CEO.
        - Present them with the information they need to know: that the company is doing the things that will make it quickly increase in value.
        - If the company is not correctly doing these things, present them with the bad news but couple it with the actions you are taking to fix the problem.
        - People who invest very early stage for a living have a different viewpoint. They know there is no company without the founders, the founders are 100% of the value of the company.
        - If you‚Äôve ever tried to pitch someone on being CEO of a small and underfunded startup, you know no sane person wants that job. No offense.
        - They did this because they had a lot at stake and because they were¬†__professionals__. You, as a founder, probably have even more at stake, so you should also treat your board professionally.
