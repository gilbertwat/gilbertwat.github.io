    - Delivery feature challenges
        - SDLC
            - Problem selection
                - The success metric or criteria is not clear for some of features.
                    - Reason:
            - Planning & Grooming
                - Complexity of frontend is not analyzed clearly.
                    - Reason:
                - Not unified flow / architecture makes a unified story points hard to achieve.
                    - Reason:
                        - Story point is a bad proxy for complexity and effort.
                - MOB tasks objectives and impact is not clear to all team members.
                    - Reason: 
            - Sprinting
                - Stories/Epic implementation status is not actively shared and resolved.
                    - Reason:
                        - 
                - Backend is always short of hands, slowing down the whole theme progress
                    - Reason:
                        - Only 1 person per theme
                - Ad-hoc tasks are always injected to the sprint, deviating from the sprint goal.
                    - Reason:
                - Too many work in progress.
                    - Reason:
                - Too many Ready For QA.
                    - Reason:
            - Retrospective
                - Any wins from the new feature we introduced in the past few quarter.
                    - Reason:
        - Deployment
            - Hot-fix process
        - Monitoring
            - Who should be monitoring the error rates in Bugsnag?
    - Habits to form as a team.
    - Action items and Governance
