                - Have a lot of experience communicating and executing reports and dashboard with business
                    - But in the interview, I cannot sense his deep understanding of business he is in.
            - Data engineer experience
                - Have a lot of experience in maintaining and developing [[ETL]] jobs.
            - Data scientist experience
                - Have production experience about deploying a machine learning model to the product
                - I don't think he is very well experienced about the crucial elements of [[machine learning]]
                    - Feature selection
                    - Model selection
                    - Category selection
