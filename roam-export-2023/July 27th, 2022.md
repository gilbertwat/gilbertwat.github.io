    - Did a [[code review]] with the interns in the `DropDown` in our subscription MVP
        - The UI element is created on-point with `DropDown` and `DropDownItem`
        - But the way of creating `DropDown` is very problematic
            - Pass in `props.children` to attach the list of `DropDownItem`
        - Ask them to experiment about user experience of creating the same UI elements
            - Current approach:
                - create `DropDownItem` somewhere manually
                - create `DropDown` and plug in `DropDownItem`
            - Challenge of current approach is that we can plug any structure in `DropDown`, expanding the scope of `DropDown`
            - Next approach:
                - create `DropDown` with an array of raw data, and `DropDown` will convert the raw data to `DropDownItem`
