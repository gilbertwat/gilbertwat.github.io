- 09:00 Meeting with [[Tommie Lo]] [[Vegas Ho]] [[Carmen Yeung]] [[Ellen Lau]] 
    - Some recap for today's meeting. Best of my memory and feel free to further discuss
        - We are going to transform from *loving* to *mutual respect*.
        - Our culture is that trust is granted until it is not.
        - Execution speed of our projects are slow to market, Hotdog project(3 months), membership project(9 months), coffee app (9 months and counting).
        - Need to instill sense of urgency without breaking the culture of respect.
        - Hence, OK to share the burn rate of the company ($100,000 HKD / day regardless of holidays).
        - Explore the balance between policing with human or process, tools or culture.
        - Ongoing piloting new ways to push projects forwards.
        - Use WFH policy as an opportunity of communicating our sense of urgency.
            - Shared [[[[Preface]] WFH policy]]
