        - First, __finite__ games are played __for the purpose of winning__.
    - Whenever you’re engaging in an activity that’s definite, bounded, 
- and where the game can be completed by mutual agreement of all the 
- players, then that’s a finite game.
    - __infinite__ games are played __for the purpose of continuing to play__.
    - You do not “win” infinite games; these are activities like learning, 
- culture, community, or any exploration with no defined set of rules nor 
- any pre-agreed-upon conditions for completion.
    - They play the infinite game of growing their status within a growing community, which is a __very good thing__.
    - There are two kinds of Bad Angels. The first kind are literally in it 
- for the money: they want to see financial returns in a reasonable period
    - of time, and push their founders to run their startups as an 
- investment, like real estate. The second kind is more subtle: they’re 
- Angels who’re doing it for the satisfaction and the status, but only 
- among their own, __closed__ peer set. They are competing for zero-sum bragging rights, not working to grow the community.
    - Good Angels have an entirely different attitude about the relationship 
- between angels and founders. They’re not trying to win something; 
- they’re trying to create something. This is a good thing, because that’s
    - exactly the mindset you need to have, if you’re founding a startup. 
- Startups are also infinite games. At the moment you found a startup, at 
- no point in the next ten years (or whatever appropriately long time 
- horizon) will you have “won” anything; nor is there a fixed set of rules
    - you’re agreeing to. __You are playing in order to keep playing.__ Your goal is growth, and growth is never done.
        - Of course, that’s not the only way to run a business. The majority of 
- businesses can be appropriately described as finite games: you’re going 
- after a bounded, definite opportunity; with a clear concept of what 
- winning looks like.
    - But these aren’t startups, the way we use the term startups. Startups 
- are a bet that the future will be radically different from the present, 
- and they are valuable on the way up because they are, effectively, a 
- call option on that future coming true. Their founders set out to 
- discover that future; their value is __indefinite__, not definite. 
- One day they might become giant, cash-gushing businesses; but not 
- anywhere near your current horizon. Your only goal right now is grow, 
- explore, and earn the right to keep growing and exploring.
    - So where do Good Angels come from? There is really only one reliable 
- source of Good Angels, and that’s big liquidity events of other 
- startups. Any other source of money is potentially suspect. But Angels 
- who’ve made their starting nest egg from founding or growing a startup 
- of their own understand the infinite game, because they’ve played it. 
- And they want to keep playing it, because they like it, and Angel 
- investing is how you do that.
    - The most visceral difference between the Canadian startup investing 
- scene versus the Bay Area is speed. It is not an incremental difference:
    - they operate on entirely different time scales. Bay Area startups can 
- go from initially announcing their pre-seed round to closing an 
- oversubscribed round of SAFE notes in 72 hours. In Canada, you’re 
- generally lucky if you can get a deal done in __3 months__.
    - Another fairly obvious difference between the Canadian startup ecosystem versus the Bay Area is that valuations are lower. It’s actually not just valuations that are lower; the price of everything is lower 
- (including salaries, which is helpful if you’re staffing entry level 
- positions but a huge problem when you’re trying to recruit experienced 
- managers & senior talent). But the valuation issue is pretty 
- central.
    - Why are milestones so dangerous? Because when you define clear 
- milestones, you initiate finite games: you’re defining and bounding the 
- problem of startup-building, and inadvertently creating a “win/loss” 
- condition upon the completion of the milestone.
    - Hopefully by now you can see this picture coming together: the 
- difference between the Canadian startup ecosystem versus the 
- actually-functioning one in the Bay Area isn’t an incremental difference
    - of degree. They’re two systems running in totally contrasting modes: 
- one runs fast, rules opportunities in, rolls valuations forward, and is 
- optimized for infinite-game-mindset founders. The other runs slow, rules
    - opportunities out, feels the need to “defend” valuations (thereby 
- collapsing them to their literal milestone value) and optimizes for 
- fixed, finite games.
    - The problem starts when founders think about SR&ED as “free money”. __It is not free__.
    - It has a cost of capital, like any capital. But instead of costing you 
- your equity, it costs you your time, your focus, and above all it costs 
- you something you can never get back which is your 
- indeterminate curiosity.
    - SR&ED forces you to play finite games, because it forces you to 
- articulate what you’re spending this money on. And so you have to 
- justify, at the very least, what problem you are solving 
- and what specific steps you are taking to solve it. You enter the world 
- of __problem definition, __where building your startup becomes Serious Work, with official time sheets and government forms.
    - My hope is that people in Canada reading this will realize that the problem facing us isn’t __a lack of anything__. The problem with our startup scene isn’t a __lack__ of money, startups, investors, hustle, great Universities, technical talent, or creativity. Our problem is actually the __presence__ of
    - actively bad things: all of our non-dilutive (but extremely expensive!)
    - innovation credits, the presence of incubators and entrepreneurship 
- programs, and the accidental costs of milestone thinking. If we want to 
- build a real startup community in Canada, we need to let go of those 
- crutches, and choose the Infinite Game.
