    - The difference between web2 and [[web3]] is exclusive vs inclusive
    - The economic is about ownership economic
        - But my counter point is that it will be very ponzi as your utility is not expansion
        - And face to face community is way more rewarding(depth), metaverse is another dimension (wide)
            - They are a compliment to each other
    - The question of serving inward (our community members) and outward (our customers) is still very much unanswered.
    - The question of diverse stakeholders is to me a burden of innovation instead, it all depends on the signal to noise ratio and the dynamic of the group (action and inaction).
        - [[GOGOX]] experience taught me the importance of Biased towards actions, anything reduce that will be a peril to

    - How to test [[machine learning]] model?
        - **Correctness:** This is a classic method in ML testing that evaluates the model’s accuracy against new datasets not seen in training.
        - **Relevance:** This property captures mismatches between model and data and is typically associated with overfitting and underfitting behavior.
        - **Robustness:** This is a non-functional property that quantifies the correctness of the model in the presence of noise in the input dataset.
        - **Efficiency:** This is related to the model’s size and the training dataset required for it to generalize.
        - **Fairness:** This is a relatively new non-functional property of ML models added to the literature. Fairness testing s related to detecting potential biases in the behavior of ML models.
        - **Interpretability:** This property assesses the ability to explain the behavior of ML models.
        - **Privacy:** This property focuses on evaluating the privacy-preserving robustness of ML models.
