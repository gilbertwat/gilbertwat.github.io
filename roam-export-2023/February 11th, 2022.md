                - A clear cut for product -> tech -> sales -> ops is hard
                    - For example product is "define what we sell / solve"
                        - It requires an input for 
                            - "what we can build" from tech
                            - "what is our customer feedback" from sales
                            - "what can we fulfill" from ops

                    - Allow IC to collaborate and contribute their expertises (tech/BGM/sales/ops)
                    - groom product managers to alleviate Directors so Directors can focus on deep dive on departmental problems and high level strategy conversation
