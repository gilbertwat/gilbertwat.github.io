- [[Preface]] Leadership Offsite on vision, mission, value with [[Hema Shah]] [[Viktor Chan]] [[Ellen Lau]] [[Carmen Yeung]] [[Alfred Tse]] [[Tommie Lo]]                      
    - Vision Keywords from everyone
        - Global, Lifestyle, learning experience, the model of education, accessibility, relevant
    - Mission
        - To build a fun, engaging, accessible education to our clients
    - Value
        - Culture Value of [[Preface]]
            - Humble to learn
            - Bold to action
    - By 2025 Q4 2026 Q4 we aim to be a #c:RED **300M USD** Annual Revenue Company
        - IPO
        - 75M USD quarterly
        - 25M USD monthly
        - #c:RED **20x current revenue**
    - We have (9Q-13Q) to go
    - Inital version how to achieve it from [[Tommie Lo]]
        - Stressed we need a "east wind" to achieve such
            - Should we bet on a comeback of web3?
        - Stressed a lack of hero product
            - We need to build it to achieve the revenue target we are aiming for
        - We need to build the content creation loop (re-iterate)
            1. Secondary Data
            2. Primary Data
            3. Committee / DAO
            4. Initial Version
            5. Content Validation by experts
            6. Marketing
            7. Sales
            8. Deployment 
        - We don't want to do content X marketing X sales to the customers.
        - Intuitively Content is more scalable than nomad deployment and delivery of services
        - Franchisee for local marketing, sales & deployment
            - Distribution channels currently we have
                - B2C Kids to international schools or top band schools
                - B2B/B2G
                    - Lunch & Learn
                    - Customized content
                    - RTTP
        - Web3 infrastructure for content asset management
            - Transforming a content to an asset class.
    - Feedback from the everyone
        - A disjoint between vision and content creation loop
            - There is no mentioning of our vision in the content creation loop
        - Not harnessing our strength on experimentation and experience building
        - The web3 project itself (step 5) can be a project itself
        - A platform (web3 or not) need to be jumpstarted
        - What is the first step to that direction?
        - Need more content investment and commitment
    - Questions to ponder?
        - What is the first step to that direction?
            - What leverage can we use with our distribution channel?
                - business owners of SMB.
                - C-suites of a local enterprise
                - more well-off parents
                - Immigrant from HK to UK
                - PolyU
                - Luxury Brand local office.
                - Higher end / financial Media
            - What can we do to pitch partners to work with us?
        - What is some hidden criteria of success?
            - Relevant content production is scalable.
