    - Common sense, in this sense, is like oxygen: the higher you go, the thinner it gets. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=415))
    - You learn to play the game by having a coach, literally a “trainer,” who does what drill instructors used to do when military service was mandatory: teach the basics, build stamina, enforce discipline, encourage collaboration, show you how to fail and to recover from failure. Once the game begins, though, your coach can only shout or sulk from the sidelines. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=494))
    - [S]uspicion of Utopias and zealots; trust in common sense and experience; respect for tradition; preference for gradual change; and the view that “compromise” is victory, not betrayal. These things stem from the failure of both royal absolutism and of godly republicanism: costly failures, and fruitful ones. ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=2382))
    - For the moment, though, Lincoln allowed logic a last chance. ([Location 3500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=3500))
    - The only real point at issue was that “[o]ne section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.” ([Location 3504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=3504))
    - an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will ([Location 3551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=3551))
    - My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. . . . I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=3607))
    - “[I]t is quite possible that God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party.” Perhaps “God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet.” ([Location 3775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=3775))
    - Which allows such leaders then to convey, to those citizens, “a sense of understanding their inner needs, of responding to their own deepest impulses, above all of being alone capable of organising the world along lines [for] which [they] are instinctively groping.” ([Location 4338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073QZX7YX&location=4338))
