        - [[March 25th, 2022]] notes
            - **Pain Points**
            - 1. Recommendation not accurate
            - 2. Review form collections
            - 3. Notifications only for 1st class
                - Propose automate category automation
                - Viewing recommendation, add teacher manual rec comment
                - teacher can either review previous class or add new content
                - **Further questions:**
                    - Problem 1: If teacher doesnt review, and 2nd teacher is assigned the upcoming class. Where should the 2nd teacher finds the right content?
                    - **Why don't Nomads do review form:**
                        - Forget to do
                        - Recommendation is not accurate, cannot do review form properly
            - **Solutions:**
                - Implement review form reminders (auto email - within 24 hour, log in screen - photo in the last message)
                - Allow teachers to unlock (un)recommended content
                - Allow Nomad team to unlock content (as a quick fix)
            - **Next steps:**
                - Functions / Buttons on Portal (to be discussed by Tech Team) - and confirm the solutions & set timeline
