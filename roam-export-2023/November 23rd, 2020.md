- [[1:1]] with [[Shamiya Patel]]
    - on [[[[GOGOX]] Driver Experience Theme]], difficulties she has been facing
        - [[Driver App]] is to complicated, hence testing it is difficult
            - Country specific logic and configurations is too much for [[Shamiya Patel]] and QA team to handle
                - Easy to miss test cases
                - Documentation is missing / too much
        - Sometimes there is no clear acceptance criteria for user stories
            - Until she ask the questions, engineers need to clarify with [[Tom Lui]].
            - No unified understanding in the user stories.
        - Not able to grasp the whole scope and functionalities in [[Driver App]]. Low confidence in her work / the quality of the app. (Mentioned to [[Paul Leung]])
            - Some knowledge in Lucien / local driver ops
            - Lack of an overview in [[Driver App]]
            - Mainly there is low confidence in old feature
    - Action items:
        - To fix [[Driver App]] is to complicated, hence testing it is difficult, 
            - Need long term fix
            - How can developers provide visibility on that??
        - To fix Sometimes there is no clear acceptance criteria for user stories,
            - [[Shamiya Patel]] will act as our last line of defense
            - Urge developers to think through those
        - To fix Not able to grasp the whole scope and functionalities in [[Driver App]]. Low confidence in her work / the quality of the app. (Mentioned to [[Paul Leung]]),
            - Identify critical components or flows with [[Tom Lui]] and acknowledge the less confidence part
- What is the next big things for [[GOGOX]]?

                    - Serve = shipping feature
                - validating of cultures
                    - no one carry forwards on the culture
    - Action items:
        - Confirm if we need thoroughly walk through design with engineers [[Gemmy Wong]]
        - Confirm if complexity mis-estimation from engineer still exists [[Gemmy Wong]]
        - Influence for an alignment between driver ops HK and tech team [[Myself]]
    - Confirmed:
        - Design sprint from ideal instead of from constraint.
