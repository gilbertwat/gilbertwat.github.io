- ### Highlights first synced by #Readwise [[August 8th, 2023]]
    - Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing Losers into middle-management, groom under-performing Losers into Sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort Losers to fend for themselves. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=158))
    - Images of Organization, ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=246))
    - They don’t have an in-group language since they don’t realize they constitute a group. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=300))
    - One of the functions of the Clueless, recall, is to provide a buffer in what would otherwise be a painfully raw master-slave dynamic in a pure Sociopath-Loser organization. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=308))
    - This is the first significant conversation between us, and I am signaling to you that I am fluent in Powertalk. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=324))
    - We can speculate with a fair amount of certainty what someone like Michael would have said in such a situation if his and Jim’s roles had been reversed. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=332))
    - Powertalk in other words, is a consequential language. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=357))
    - Another way to understand the difference between Powertalk and the other languages is with a card-playing analogy. In Powertalk, you play with valuable currency, usually reality-information. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=362))
    - The bulk of Sociopath communication takes places out in the open, coded in Powertalk, right in the presence of non-Sociopaths. A decent 101-level example of this is in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when Hermoine is the only one who realizes that Professor Umbridge’s apparently bland and formulaic speech is actually a Powertalk speech challenging Dumbledore. As the David-Jim example shows, Sociopaths are in fact more careful in private. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=378))
    - The Clueless distort reality. The Losers distort rewards and penalties. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=539))
    - The Sociopaths distort the metaphysics of human life. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=541))
    - A rule of thumb in the teaching profession states that to be an effective teacher at a given level, you need to have studied five years beyond that level. This has nothing to do with subject-matter expertise, and everything to do with trying to exit the Curse of Development zone. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=558))
    - Table stakes and skill at using them is what matters. Sociopaths pay attention to what you have, and how well you bargain with it. Not who you are. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=989))
    - It probably surprises you that even when the victim is in-group, there is appreciation/depreciation of social capital. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=995))
    - But the social capital does appreciate and depreciate through the churning economy of jokes, sympathy, moaning, commiseration, solidarity, anger/derision directed against out-groupers, and so forth. That whole chaotic chemistry that we dignify with the word “culture” and structure with grand narratives. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1004))
    - This isn’t particularly surprising. Our brains are designed like our bodies: just as we possess backs that others can scratch more easily than ourselves, our brains contain “backs,” so to speak. That’s where happiness lives, and is brought alive by empathic scratching. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1024))
    - You cringe when you anticipate pain. Physical cringing, such as the cowering reaction you instinctively produce when you realize your car is going to hit another car, or when you realize somebody is going to hit you, serves to mitigate the anticipated damage. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1030))
    - Hanlon’s Razor is double-edged, and Sociopaths use it to feign incompetence themselves or to charge others with incompetence, as necessary. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1128))
    - voluntary delinquency, descent into madness, suicide and involuntary delinquency. There is nothing fundamental about these four. There are many others. In Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities for instance, the exit path is a hit-and-run accident followed by a legal nightmare. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1955))
    - For many families in America the fall is triggered by a medical bankruptcy. In A Streetcar Named Desire, Blanche duBois is forced through an exit filled with abuse and violence, to a sanitarium. ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=1957))
    - The equivalent of reading is consuming rich fictional raw material, since your own workplace will likely offer a limited amount of action to observe. Television and movies work best, since they allow you to go beyond words and read workplace architecture, body language and facial expressions. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=2000))
    - While you can also practice writing in safe contexts such as improv theater, dealing with real career risks – live fire exercises as it were – is necessary if you are serious about developing your skills. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=2004))
    - The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Universe: This sprawling science-fiction comedy has far too many gems of organizational literacy raw material to enumerate. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F9IV64W&location=2026))
