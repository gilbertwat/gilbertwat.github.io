- How do you feel when you wake up?
    - I cannot give up the emotion of being let down by the fact that I have fixed the team (mostly), but now the new VP is coming to reap my harvest.
        - Why I am having this emotion?
            - I have invested enormous time, thought and energy to it.
            - I am not being actively coached.
            - But I was required to do active coaching to my peers and direct report.
            - I am stretched for too long (3 years)
            - And there is no reward and trust gained.
                - I am actually very trilled when I heard KC and Emily recognize me.
        - How can I mitigate that / put it into good use?

        - I found this piece a good reminder for a regular check if our agile team falls into those pitfalls.
        - We have already mostly conquered the
        - **Agile vs Waterfall ** 🎉
        - We sometimes are particularly prone to, imho in descending order,
        - **The “Delivery Size Throughput” ****__(sometimes the stories are too big / incur some tech debts)__**
        - **The “Knowledge Silos” ****__(suggest we all "build a second brain" for each teams to build on the knowledge and iterations with everyone)__**
        - **The “Initiative Size, Risk and Leadership Involvement” ****__(suggest we do a lot of tuning in every areas (CI/CD, product, agile process...etc), instead of a big bang initiative)__**
        - **but we just need a constant reminder to do the right things (small changes, aware difference in context, always aligned knowledge and directions at least within teams)
        - **We are not facing the **The “Segmentation Value”** because, we don't have a lot of segmentation (yet) 😅
