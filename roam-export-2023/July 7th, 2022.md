- [[Preface]] SG expansion tour presentation
    - Pros
        - Superb, top notch presentation
        - Clear messages
    - Cons
        - Execution and strategy suggestion is a bit ideal
            - The cost part is greatly underestimated
            - The plan is too grand and skip a lot of execution
            - We need a longer expansion tour to validate more
            - Potential conflicting strategy
                - B2B first needs a big investment of presence, branding, word of mouth...etc.
                - Why we are able to get so many deals is that our space is prime and flexible enough for those global brand
    - Suggestion
        - Not to merge with the subscription PoC with adult market as we are also testing out in B2C adult market in Hong Kong.
        - We are definitely able to attract corporate deals through physical spaces in Hong Kong.
        - We could focus on a more upscaled Kids B2C market first as there is no competitors in that space.
    - One of the learning is that with what composition of the team will come up with a certain course of action [[Build a world class team to build a world class product]]
        - Kevin -> Teaching
        - Mark -> Teaching
        - Sylvia -> B2B sales
        - Annie -> Marketing
        - The outcome is very marketing / B2B oriented
        - should we put an engineer in the mix the outcome could be a bit more technology driven
    - [[Tommie Lo]] seems very focus on the aesthetic of deliverables
        - Need to supplement with facts and strategy
    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Shared within the leadership team
