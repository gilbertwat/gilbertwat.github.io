        - Key message
            - In the past quarter, not as productive as we all want.
            - Went through the PRs on Github, a lot of back and forth. It is a sign.
            - Further investigate into detail, See some current key issues, those are blocking to the team productivity
                - Assigned responsibility is not fulfilled timely.
                    - Function is not completed when it is claimed to be ready for code review
                    - Communication such as git commit message or the description in the PR is not clear.
            - Those are **red flags** in our team as we cannot fulfill team goal.
            - I believe it is a will issue, instead of a capabilities issue.
            - If you resolve these **red flags**, we will consider you as a capable "Lead", equivalent to an intermediate engineer.
            - You are now Assistant Manager, so we should consider you as a capable senior software engineer, with more expectation.
            - If you cannot resolve it in this quarter, I am afraid we cannot work together.
        - Suggested solution
            - Before coding on a certain task, Have a brief plan of
                - expected customer experience
                - component to be upgrade and its behavior
                - APIs to call
            - Finally, make an estimated total time needed for the tasks
            - AND share the brief plan with [[Gilbert Wat]] and [[Ben Cheng]] as soon as it is done (1/2 day max)
        - **Help the team win together.**
        - Tone
            - As objective and factual as possible
            - encouraging and believing
