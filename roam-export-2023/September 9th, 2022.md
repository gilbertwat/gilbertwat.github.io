            - Hi Tommie,

This is our first weekly summary, so please let me know if you want to add/remove any part of this summary. I hope this is not too long and you can finish it within 3 minutes, in a techbites way.

## Projects

### Seamless Buy Link

We have demoed our [purchase link for annual pass](https://app.preface.ai/purchase/annual-pass) to most of the stakeholders like design, sales and comEx team. We are confident we can use it in this weekend and Momo, Ben and me will be standing by for any tech issues.
For next week we will start implementing buy link for purchasing individual bootcamp. 

Everything iS to be on schedule.

### Customer Portal

We have scheduled customer interviews in next week. We also collected data from Sleekflow about the request from customers. Those customers are mostly contacting us for scheduling problem. We found the intuition from Anna is matching the data.

In the coming weeks, we will go deep into the scheduling problem our customer faced and it will be likely our scope of MVP for customer portal.

Down the line, suggesting and allowing customer to buy the next courses should be one of the revenue generator.

### Credit System

Will discuss about unifying different credits with Kenneth next week. See if we can combine with our tokenomics if possible.

### Data dashboard

We have completed the data warehouse with all aspects of the business in portal now. We will ship our v1 of company dashboard with other analytics such as review and usage next week.

### A.I.

We have a discussion with content team and found out the most challenging part is actually "decide which topic to create content for". We will brainstorm an MVP to solve that problem.

## Team update

We will offboard Ken this week. The responsibility will be split with Anna and I for now.

We will prepare onboarding senior software engineer. His first day will be Oct 3rd.

There is some struggling for Ehsan to grow further, our next challenge will be bringing him up to standard.
