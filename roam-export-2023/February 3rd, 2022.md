    - Using the distribution of tweets ‚¨õ üü® üü©, we are already have information to guess the correct word in the 1st guess
    - Information needed
        - Tweets of the current day Wordle
        - Possible answers
            - 5-character English words from source code + other valid but less common WORD
        - Simulate 1000 games for each possible answers, based on the frequency of the word in English language and feedback received.
    - 3 measures to evaluate observed result of tweets
        - Frequency of 243 possible combinations in observed  / simulated games.
            - Rank all valid words by cosine similarity between simulated and observed distributions
        - the fraction of these combinations that occur right before the correct guess
            - rank valid words based on the cosine similarity distance between the observed and simulated distrubtion
        - based on the valid words there's invalid combinations for each possible answer.
            - rank valid words on the number of invalid combination we observe.
