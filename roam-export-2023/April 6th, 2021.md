- #[[🧘🏻‍♂️ Self Awareness]] One of my recurring theme for me to do better and better is the identity of myself. I regard myself as a husband, a bigger brother, a manager, a leader, a CTO, a libertarian...etc. And there are social construct that bound me to the very identity I identify myself into. I don't think it serves me well in [[preventing burnout]], as I am having burnout every 3 months, it is worse than flu.
    - All of these identity is pushing me to go forward, alone.
    - I am not happy to be always stuck in those demanding identities
        - Why are they demanding? I am aware of the "boundaries" they have and innately abide to them.
- #[[🧘🏻‍♂️ Self Awareness]] One of the current event I cannot control about thinking myself is some "gurus" is attacked by selling his home for 43m HKD with a [[APY]] of 7.5%. 
    - I am not happy with the dispute created. And the ugly side of the feud.
        - People can remember mistreat for a very long time.
        - People are not focusing on the right thing because of past feud and attack.
