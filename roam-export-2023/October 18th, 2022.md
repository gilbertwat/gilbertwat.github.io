        - Can you explain the basic logic of your A.I. model and what are the key data feeding into the model?
            - Our A.I. recommendation system uses a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to do user-based collaborative filtering for students' class project recommendation. The key data being used by the model are the project reviews provided by students after taking our classes.
        - Please provide the credential of your A.I. development team. Do you own the IP right of the A.I. algorithm and system?
            - Our engineering leadership consists of tech leaders in acclaimed companies such as [[GOGOX]], Accenture, Loco and OpenRice. They have led, architected and built data intensive systems such as wallet system, online order-matching system, critical metric tracking system with high uptime and low latency business requirements.
            - Our Data and AI practitioners are a team of passionate educator-turned data engineers and researchers. They have in-depth knowledge in education and research. They are also passionate about better educating our students through impactful application of AI.
            - We are now focusing on the application of AI and owning IP and publishing educational research is our long term goal.
        - Where do you host your A.I. system and database?
            - We are taking a multi-cloud approach to our A.I. system to leverage the best in each provider.
            - Our model training system is hosted inside the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem. We make use of several services such as Google BigQuery for highly scalable columnar storage and Google Compute Engine for flexible vertical scaling for automation of our A.I recommender system.
            - The predictions are deployed to our company's Portal application hosted on AWS.
        - Do you have any data or statistics that can support the argument that Preface's classes are more effective and / or have a higher enrolment and renewal rate compared to other computer education academies in Hong Kong?
            - The renewal rate for students in Preface that are using our recommender system is 28.8% better than the renewal rate of students who are not. 
            - As Preface is taking a trailblazing approach to create adaptive content with the help of an A.I. recommendation system, there are no other computer education academy competitors in Hong Kong that we can compare to.
