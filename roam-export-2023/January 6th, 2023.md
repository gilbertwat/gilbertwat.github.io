    - #learning how to do R&D [[budgeting]] based on Revenue projections
        - A new framework to do team planning
            - Revenue based / projected revenue / revenue stream based budgeting
                1. We need to start with the top figure, choose 1 that is applicable.
                    - For example: in the last quarter, our revenue is 24m, we are projecting 36m in the coming quarter
                2. Based on the split of the revenue streams, we can calculate the usage
                    - For example: in the last quarter, for B2C/B2B/B2G is split by 20/20/60.
                3. Come up with the current department expenses
                    - For example: in tech team we are supporting B2C/B2B, hence the revenue stream we are supporting will be 3.2m / 4.8m per month.
                4. Come up with a percentage you think it makes sense based on your conversation with other leaders.
                    - For example: in tech team we are a R&D department, I think we should be 10% - 15% of our expensess and we are operating at a 0 profit (depends on the stage of the company, as we are in growth stage we should be operating at 0 profit)
                    - Hence the range of the budget should be 320k - 720k per month.
                5. So we can start planning for 320k, 720k and 520k.
                6. Assume the current team expense is 300K
            - {{[[DONE]]}}  Actual Plan
                - Plan A for the least budget: ~20K
                    - Hire 1 more senior engineer (50000)
                    - Expected outcome in 2023 if we are able to retain
                        - 33% decrease of lead time in customer portal
                - Plan B for the medium budget: ~220K
                    - Hire 1 more AM senior engineer (40000 - 50000)
                    - Hire 1 more L designer (20000 - 35000)
                    - Hire 1 more AM PM (40000)
                    - Expected outcome
                        - We can handle 1 more project in parallel
                - Plan C for the high budget: ~420K
                    - Hire 2 more AM senior engineer (40000 - 50000)
                    - HIre 2 more L engineer (20000-35000)
                    - Hire 2 more L designer (20000 - 35000)
                    - Hire 2 more AM PM (40000)
                    - Hire an agency to work with us on creating a next-gen classroom experience with extended reality (100000)
                    - Expected outcome
                        - We can handle 2 more project in parallel

            - Expectation setting
                - Sharing {{[[DONE]]}}  Proposed tech team plans
                - Got approval on the framework
        - Notes
            - Shared about the challenge in Glassdoor recently.
                - Someone is leaving bad reviews on Glassdoor and it hampers the international expansion hiring effort.
            - Shared about the current team situation, especially with the OGs.
                - Anna is picking up more strategic scope and Moses is solid in the AM level.
                - Moses may have an urge to compare himself with Mark and we will explain to Moses with our best effort.
            - Shared about the expectation of our customer portal.
                - The customer portal should look good for B2C sales to wow our customers.
                - The customer portal ideally should be an app for perceived value.
            - Aligned we will de-prioritize our coffee app in Q1.
            - Shared about the #learning of 2022 in communication within leadership team
                - Gilbert will work on more timely updates of projects, especially when there will be delays.
                - Gilbert will work on a one-liner for all leaders to understand the technical challenges.
                - Gilbert will work on repeating project goals and ensure common understanding among leadership team.
            - Aligned we can increase the R&D budget in 2023.
                - Gilbert will formulate the proposal.

        - Quotes
            - To borrow a quote from John Young, keeping such a program funded through fifteen consecutive Congresses would require a series “of continuous miracles, interspersed with acts of God”.
                - This is also a #learning in project proposal: Do not propose a program that takes more than 4 cycle of re-prioritization.
            - every major discovery made in space this century has come from robotic spacecraft
                - #learning in making decision: Always make bet on human to improve the machine rather than human can do X better.
            - But the fact that a Mars landing stopped making sense has not had the slightest impact on NASA’s plan to go there in a rocket-propelled terrarium. Though facts may change, and technology may change, one thing will always remain the same—we’re going to Mars, 1950’s style.
                - #learning for continuing a project or not: Do a plain and remove all assumption might be a helpful way for us to evaluate the usefulness of a project in the current context.
                    - I am not sure for the Mars exploration though, I think it is helpful we keep improving space probing tech to satisfy the human nature of exploration as a species.
            - The chief technical obstacle to a Mars landing is not propulsion, but a lack of reliable closed-loop life support. With our current capability, NASA would struggle to keep a crew alive for six months on the White House lawn, let alone for years in a Martian yurt.
            - What makes life support so vexing is that all the subcomponents interact with each other and with the crew. There’s no such thing as a life support unit test; you have to run the whole system in space under conditions that mimic the target mission. Reliability engineering for life support involves solving mysteries like why gunk formed on a certain washer on Day 732, then praying on the next run that your fix doesn’t break on Day 733. The process repeats until the first crew makes it home alive (figuratively speaking), at which point you declare the technology reliable and chill the champagne.
