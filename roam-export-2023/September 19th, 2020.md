    - Excerpt
        - absence of trust
        - help members focus on strengths rather than weaknesses in other members and in themselves too. 
        - fear of conflict
        - A good way to resolve it is assigning “a devil’s advocate” on the meeting. Let one person find faults with any suggestion that is voiced encouraging other members to defend their point of view.
        - lack of commitment 
        - First, make it a rule to summarise all key decisions made during the meeting and the rationale for taking them. If the meeting is with the managing staff, clarify what should and should not be communicated to a larger team.
        - You can also facilitate the commitment by encouraging the team to discuss possible pitfalls and worst-case scenarios; again, clarity is the basis for commitment. Define clear deadlines not only for the actions, but for decisions themselves. This way, team members will assume responsibility to arrive at the best possible decision and commit to it, rather than just postpone the solution..
        - avoidance of accountability 
        - You may resolve this dysfunction by holding regular progress reviews and rewarding team achievements rather than individuals. Make it clear for individuals that hold high standards of performance as their HIGH5 strength that holding others accountable will be appreciated and rewarded.
        - inattention of result
        - For your team to keep focus on common results, it is vital to have clear metrics to assess results. If the team already knows how to keep each other accountable, they will push each other toward pursuing common not individual goals. As in the case with the avoidance of accountability, rewards should be based on team rather than individual results and achievements.
        - If the urge to get individual recognition or please one’s ego is a part of a team member’s personality, it is not necessary to fight or punish it. Instead, use strengths based approach and make sure individuals’ zeal align well with the common goals
    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Takeaways
        - Trust leads to collaboration. Collaboration leads to commitment. Commitment leads to accountability. Accountability leads to result.
        - Praise and encouragement build trust.

    - Excerpt
        - Stay in close enough contact. Keep in mind that a remote underperformer can’t just drop in to check on things or “take your temperature.” It’s on you as their manager to stay in regular touch and to keep them in the loop. Don’t assume that no news is good news. After you’ve given an employee candid feedback and they don’t hear from you, they can start to worry that you’re ignoring them because you’ve written them off, and their performance can deteriorate further. 
        - This is something you do with underperformers in any context, but when you don’t see the employee in person, it’s even more important to ask yourself whether your statements have been ambiguous. Part of this process is separating out whether your dissatisfaction is with their work products, or with the way they deliver.
        - If you suspect the underperformer’s difficulties come from insufficient experience, specific skill deficits, or a lack of business or organizational acumen, consider whether they need training, or to partner with a more experienced colleague. This may be more challenging in a remote environment, but it’s too risky to wait until you’re back in the office to provide the support they need.
        - As much as possible, use questions to encourage them to self-diagnose and to project into their own future: “How will this experience set you up to do better in the future?” I often ask coaching clients “Why do you think I’m asking you this?” to encourage them to reach their own conclusions, rather than telling them what I have observed, which doesn’t trigger the same kind of “aha” that self-discovery does.
    - {{[[DONE]]}}  Takeaways
        - Even for remote colleague you need to build closeness.
        - Be crystal clear about your message.
        - Bring extra training resource to the colleague to bridge the required skill set of the colleague.
