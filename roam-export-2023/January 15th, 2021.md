    - Some good news! 🎉 Since [[Victor Lam]] is leaving 😞, we are lucky to have [[Ben Cheng]] to step up and take the challenge. Ben will be our Acting team lead in Platform team and he has the full support from his teammates, me and the management. He is a detailed oriented, get the job done guy. Without him, a lot of business critical features and iteration cannot be shipped with such cadence and quality. I hope to work closer with him and bring platform team more together. We can get through this tough time together.
