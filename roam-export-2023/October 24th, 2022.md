        - [[Literature Notes]]
            - [[Tag]] is hard to use right.
            - If we implement sub-tag we will come across transitive queries.
            - transitive queries are queries on a [[transitive relation]].
            - [[transitive relation]] is defined as $$if (a,b)\in R, and (b,c) \in R, then (a,c) \in R$$
            - transitive queries are expensive.
            - transitive queries are hard to detect cycle.
            - Multiple parents are even harder.
