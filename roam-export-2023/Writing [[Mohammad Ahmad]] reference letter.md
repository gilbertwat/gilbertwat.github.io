- Deliverable
    - To whom it may concern,

I am more than happy to write on behalf of Mohammad Ahmad, who is applying to XXXXXXXXXXXX. I interact with him as his supervisor in [[GOGOX]]. He stands out as one of the brightest up and coming technologists.

He has joined us for 1.5 years, working as a web engineer. He iterates our web portal for our small & medium business customers with our web team. He has grown to a valuable team member. Hence he earned his promotion only after 8 months since he joined.

His hard work is evident in his consistent improvement of his work quality. He keeps on taking more important and complex projects. He started with implementing simple fixes, for instance UI glitches and small forms improvement. And he can now add new functionalities with complex user flows and third party system integration, such as integrating 3DS into our payment flow. 

Not only does he excel in assigned projects, he is also capable of spotting and fixing important but behind the scene issues. He has proactively implemented improvements such as extracting common UI components and replacing old developer tools, in the systems he is working on. Those improvements contributed to the flexibility and stability of the system.

Other than taking more challenging work, he also displays great curiosity in knowledge. He consistently demonstrates his eagerness to learn new technology and his precise understanding of new technology. He has shared with his fellow software engineers applications of new technology such as GraphQL in our routine sharing sessions. Feedback from the audience was always great.

The keenness to learn and share knowledge, coupled with work on obscure internal issues brought him a lot of good will among the engineers. Not only among the engineers, he is also a favorite among product managers, quality and data experts, because of his candor and openness. He has suggested and convinced his teammates to adopt better practices to improve communication and efficiency of the team.

All of my experience displayed his hard work, focus on fundamentals, curiosity and great interpersonal attitude, which I believe is crucial to the success of a research program. In case you need more information or examples, do not hesitate to contact me via my email g@chachaanteng.co or call me at (+852) 9373 9813. Once again it is my pleasure to elaborate further about my experience interacting with Mohammad Ahmad.

Best Wishes,
Gilbert Wat
Engineering Manager, [[GOGOX]]
