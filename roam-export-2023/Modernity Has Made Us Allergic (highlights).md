    - Bacteria in the gut increased 10- to 100-fold after solid foods were introduced. This stage of rapid microbiome growth and development, called “pathogenic imprinting,” seems to determine one’s susceptibility to inflammatory disorders like allergy and autoimmune disorders in adulthood. Antibiotics could theoretically disrupt this developmental stage, producing a greater risk of allergic diseases.

So far, scientific evidence appears to back this up. Research by Rutgers University and the Mayo Clinic [found](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33208243/) that children under age two who are given antibiotics are at greater risk for asthma, respiratory allergies, eczema, celiac disease, obesity and ADHD. The study looked at 14,572 children born in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 2003 and 2011. If antibiotics were given in their first six months, the risk increased dramatically.

    - Researchers found that 70% of the children in the study had been prescribed at least one antibiotic in the first 48 months of their lives (typically for respiratory or ear infections). Another study [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796951/) that antibiotics can allow for the growth of non-pathogenic fungus in the human gut, which may make respiratory allergies more severe. Finally, related studies of [Finnish](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad0917) and [New York](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad7121) babies [found](https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/15/antibiotics-c-sections-may-change-childs-health-for-the-long-term/) that C-sections and antibiotics correlated with altered gut microbiomes and a greater risk of allergies in childhood.

    - These findings don’t surprise Nagler. Vaginal births give infants what are known as “founder bacteria,” she tells me. As the baby moves through the vaginal canal, it is exposed to its mother’s friendly bacteria. Breastfeeding introduces more helpful bacteria into the infant’s gut.

    - Research has shown that babies born by C-section not only haven’t been exposed to the correct, harmless vaginal founder bacteria, but they have also been exposed to potentially harmful hospital bacteria. One recent review [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10146705/) that lactobacillus containing probiotics — the same bacilli found in breast milk — lowered SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) scores for children under age three who had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, or more severe eczema.
