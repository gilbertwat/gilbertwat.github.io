    - Excerpt
        - When building a tool, it‚Äôs easy to forget how much you‚Äôve internalized: how much knowledge and context you‚Äôve assumed. Your tool can feel familiar or even obvious to you while being utterly foreign to everyone else.
        - To maximize your impact, then, teaching must be central to your strategy. This means documentation, tutorials, examples, videos, tweets, and more.
        - Of all forms of documentation, examples seem to be the most effective. I‚Äôve long espoused¬†[the merits of examples](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/example/), and both Observable and its predecessor bl.ocks.org aim to help people produce and consume examples to accelerate learning.
        - But there‚Äôs also a limit. As one person, you can‚Äôt help everyone. And you can‚Äôt make everyone happy because your tool is only a tiny part of their life.
        - Visualization is a spectrum: from exploratory to explanatory.
        - The goal of exploratory visualization is primarily speed: how quickly can you construct a view that answers your question?
        - You can afford to cut corners when you‚Äôre the intended reader as you already have context. Whereas you must provide explicit context for an explanatory graphic. A good explanatory graphic should know what it‚Äôs trying to say¬†__and say it__.
        - In most cases, working with data should be 80% of the work of visualization.
        - A given visual form ‚Äî say the pie chart or treemap ‚Äî isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù in an absolute sense, but it may or may not be appropriate to your data and the specific question you want answered. The only way to know whether a form is effective is if it communicates: you must put your data in it and see. So don‚Äôt set out to use a specific form; instead set out to answer a specific question of your data.
        - In the past you‚Äôd complain to friends or coworkers about how bad D3 is, and maybe they‚Äôd help you get over the hump or they‚Äôd know you were venting. But with the internet I hear it, now, too.
        - So if you find yourself complaining on the internet, please think about the practical impact of your words. If it‚Äôll only discourage and contribute to burnout, maybe vent offline? Or better: think about how you can personally contribute to make the tool better, either through pull requests or documentation or support. That, after all, is the beauty of open source.
        - In other words, find a team (or community) that can provide validation, feedback, support, and mentorship. Maybe this is obvious to everyone but me ‚Äî¬†__yes, Mike, friends are good__¬†‚Äî but I feel like it‚Äôs worth repeating today when so much human interaction happens at a distance.
    - Takeaways
        - [[Example]] is one of the best way for people to learn new stuff.
        - Doing support is a great way to do [[product discovery]], [[understanding users]]' pain points.
        - In [[data visualization]], [[Exploratory¬†graphics]] you make for yourself to find new insights in data.¬†
        - In [[data visualization]], [[Explanatory¬†graphics]] in contrast communicate some already-known insight to an audience.
        - In [[data visualization]], the goal of designing a [[Exploratory¬†graphics]] is speed of constructing a view to answer your questions.
        - [[data visualization]] is best used to answer **one** certain question.

- [[1:1]] with [[Young]]
- One of the [[Globalized self]] is about the timezone I am stationed in. Most of the events interested to me (Engineering, tech entrepreneurship)are hosted  in GMT(+0000) / PT(-0800). This may be hampered my goal in [[Globalized self]] if I stationed in HKT(+0800). [[Where should I station?]]
- [[[[GOGOX]] Payment Theme]] [[business]] [[cashflow]]
    - TIL from [[Kelvin Chan]] some finance(Payment) x system problem knowledge to share.Currently we have 4 types of charging, all of them requires different treatment from finance team. So on the system perspective it may be useful for us to separate treatment, solution design and report designs.
        - [[Prepaid]] (Customers pay us before we provide services)
        - [[Instant]] (Customers pay us right on we provide services)
        - [[Bill in arrears]] (Customers pay us after we provide services, every end of the period, be it weekly, monthly‚Ä¶etc.)
        - [[Subscription]] (Customers pay in the start of the period to use some of our services within our capacity) [[[[GOGOX]] subscription module]]
