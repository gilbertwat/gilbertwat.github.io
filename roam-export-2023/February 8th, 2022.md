        - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Preface]] Why Cancelling schedule is now through ticketing system.?
            - **Last min cancellation of class (within 2 hours before class) - Insufficient time to cancel class (by ComOps team)**
                - from clients
                - from nomads
            - **2. Last min reassignment of class (by Nomad / ComOps team)**
                - sub teacher taking over a class when a Nomad last min report sick // no show
            - **3. Bootcamps / regular course students - data mismatch (by ComOps team)**
                - student absent from a bootcamp (both adult / kids) > no time / no way to change the data until after class
                - student absent from a bootcamp (both adult / kids) > no one knows until Nomad points out after class
            - **4. Special class arrangement**
                - Insufficient time for ComOps to communicate with tech team for special class opening (e.g. private class // bootcamp content taught with 1:1 format)
            - **5. Students' shift of course**
                - Insufficient time for ComOps to communicate with tech team for change of course before class starts (e.g. From Scratch Jr > Scratch)
        - {{[[DONE]]}} Why does a QR Code after the class is not working to guarantee the attendance?
            - ^ we tried to implement it. **But when it comes to operations, there were many hiccups**
                - **ComOps: **Onsite support forgot to take out the QR code for teachers to scan // Too much work for them
                - **QR code failure**
                - **Nomad Team:** Difficult to understand the class schedule, reporting time, and whether a teacher is late
            - So, now, we have left trial run behind
