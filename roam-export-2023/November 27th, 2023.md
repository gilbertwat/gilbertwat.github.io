    Discussion with [[Ben Cheng]] [[Joseph Chan]]
        - Discussion on the reliability of [[[[Preface]] [[product]]: Customer Portal]]
            - [[Gilbert Wat]] will add a routine to check on my boss on investor meetings.
            - [[Joseph Chan]] will make sure the word "ready" is "production ready", even with a potential of a hard conversation with [[Tommie Lo]]
        - Discussion on the optics of [[[[Preface]] [[project]]: #sourcing CRM]] and the lack of importance on the stakeholders
            - We might need to be a team to constantly promoting our work.
        - Discussion on the perceived delay of [[[[Preface]] [[project]]: Techbites Free]] 
            - [[Joseph Chan]] takes the initiative to speed up the process as he will feel the urge of [[Tommie Lo]]
                - Good but not ideal as it may make the process flow and conversation more complicated.
                    - [[Joseph Chan]] may want to discuss with [[Ben Cheng]] and possibly [[Gilbert Wat]] to see how to make no drama
            - The priority is not clear
                - Even leadership team has such problems
        - Review:
            - Is this meeting about revenue generating?
                - Yes. We are discussing how to support [[Tommie Lo]] fund raising activities and how to make sure CRM is a success to generate more revenue in a more sustainable way.
            - Is this related to the system of value creation?
                - Yes. How to run projects and skip track in a productive and no drama way is essential to get the job done with no drama.
            - Is this related to our customers
                - No.
