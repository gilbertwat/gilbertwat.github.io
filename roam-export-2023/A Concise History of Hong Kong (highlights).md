    - Hong Kong has been China’s most critical link to the rest of the world since the Silk Road and the Mongols. Until recent decades, about 90 percent of all Chinese emigrants went through Hong Kong. From the 1960s until the 1980s, Hong Kong exported goods throughout the world. More recently, it has attained worldwide acclaim for its innovative cinema. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=116))
    - American opium traders had a significant presence in early colonial Hong Kong, and the colony was a major terminus for America’s transpacific trade in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, importing goods such as ginseng, flour, lumber, and kerosene and exporting commodities such as silk, tea, rattan, and human labor. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=170))
    - 5 G. B. Endacott, until the 1970s the foremost historian of Hong Kong, wrote, “A healthy trade demanded settled conditions, suppression of robbery, guarantee of contract and of impartial justice. Since the Chinese were thought to be unable to provide these conditions, the British had to provide them. This is fundamental to understanding any history of Hong Kong.”6 ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=276))
    - “Hong-kong bay is one of the finest which I have ever seen: it is eight or ten miles in length, and irregular in breadth; in some places two, and in other six miles wide, having excellent anchorage all over it, and perfectly free from hidden dangers. It is completely sheltered by the mountains of Hong-kong on the south, and by those of the main land of China on the opposite shore; land-locked, in fact, on all sides; so that the shipping can ride out the heaviest gales with perfect safety.”8 ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=302))
    - On January 25, 1841, Captain Edward Belcher landed with a small group on the northern shore of the island and raised the British flag at what would become known as Possession Point. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=344))
    - Chow Shouson, ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=363))
    - For most of these collaborators, however, working with the British was primarily a matter of wealth and power. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=370))
    - One colorful collaborator was Loo Aqui, who rose to prominence through piracy and provisioning foreign vessels. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=371))
    - Like many other fishing communities, they often resorted to piracy, especially when economic conditions were rough. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=373))
    - Loo was later rewarded for provisioning the British forces with a large plot of valuable land in the Lower Bazaar, where much of the Chinese population of Hong Kong would eventually settle. He soon became one of the colony’s wealthiest and most powerful Chinese residents. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=376))
    - Kwok Acheong ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=378))
    - In the 1860s Kwok started a fleet of steamships that competed with the European-owned Hong Kong, ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=382))
    - Tam Achoy, the most successful of these contractors, was one of the most prominent members of the Chinese community in early colonial Hong Kong. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=388))
    - An elaborate system of monopolies, usually offered for sale by public ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=395))
    - The largest and longest-lasting of the monopolies was the opium monopoly, which in the nineteenth century could make up almost one-quarter of the government’s annual revenue. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=398))
    - By 1845, European visitors frequently commented on Hong Kong’s palatial government buildings and opulent merchants’ residences. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=416))
    - In May 1843, almost 25 percent of the British garrison died of malaria. Piracy was rampant, and crime—especially theft and burglary—was equally bad on land. Even Government House, the governor’s office and residence, was burgled on April 26, 1843, while two large British firms were burgled two nights later. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=429))
    - Any attempts to attribute these mass departures to a sense of Chinese patriotism or loyalty to the Qing government are also complicated by the fact that the departures were not always voluntary. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=608))
    - Opium was so lucrative that from 1845 to 1941 the Hong Kong government derived much of its revenue from the trade. Indeed, writes historian Christopher Munn, “the opium trade and Hong Kong are so obviously intertwined that it is hardly possible to consider the early history of the colony without some reference to the drug: the colony was founded because of opium; it survived its difficult early years because of opium; its principal merchants grew rich on opium; and its government subsisted on the high land rent and other revenue made possible by the opium trade.” ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=741))
    - Like opium, however, this was a trade from which foreign and Chinese merchants alike benefited. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=754))
    - In addition to the British and the Chinese, there were Eurasians, Indians, Portuguese from Macau, Jews from Bombay, other Europeans, Armenians, and Americans. As in most colonial dual cities, these communities lived in two main areas from the earliest days, with European businesses and residences claiming the better land and Chinese settling mainly in small huts along the beach and on the overlooking hillsides. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=764))
    - Most of the Chinese who came to Hong Kong in the early years were from the lower classes, such as laborers, artisans, Tanka outcasts, prostitutes, wanderers, and smugglers. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=783))
        - **Note**: Great Great Great grandpa came to Hong Kong in the age of nine, and join his uncle. So he should not be starting from a very prominent background.
    - One important feature of the Chinese social structure in early Hong Kong was temples such as the Man Mo Temple, which was dedicated to the worship of the gods of literature and war. Another early temple, the Kwong Fook Yee Chee, was a place where Chinese could worship their ancestors. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=789))
    - Although these strikes rarely achieved their goals, they are evidence of a growing sense of collective action. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=793))
    - They relied on loans from Hong Kong banks to finance the war and depended on weapons and munitions imported through the colony, and they did not want to risk Britain teaming up with France. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=813))
    - We know considerably more about the Chinese elites of Hong Kong than about the middle and working classes, mainly because they appear more often in government records and because they formed various organizations that have left written records. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=821))
    - With a government determined to run its colony as cheaply as possible and taking so little interest in its Chinese subjects, these people had to rely on themselves and personal networks and to foster their own leadership to represent their needs and interests. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=826))
    - The temple also evolved into the self-managed, informal government of the Chinese community, with the merchants electing a committee to deliberate disputes. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=835))
    - The establishment of the District Watch Force in 1866 enabled the leaders of the Chinese business community to deal with the colonial government’s inability to control crime. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=839))
    - Another important Chinese organization was the Nam Pak Hong Kung So, established in 1868. Originally founded as a mutual assistance association for the Nam Pak Hong (the various Chinese import-export firms), this became the largest commercial and occupational group in the colony. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=847))
    - The most important Chinese voluntary organization in Hong Kong was the Tung Wah Hospital, established in 1869. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=852))
    - Europeans in early Hong Kong fell into five main groups: colonial officials, merchants, professionals, those in supervisory or low-status jobs, and missionaries for groups such as the London Missionary Society. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=870))
    - Visitors to Hong Kong were frequently struck by the aloofness of the local Europeans, their lack of interest in Chinese culture, and their scorn and disdain for the local Chinese, and noted how they would beat Chinese workers with sticks and umbrellas. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=878))
        - **Note**: Until today, the expats community is separated from the local community.
    - The Portuguese, who were more likely than the British to marry Chinese and to speak Cantonese, appear to have ranked intermediate between other Europeans and Eurasians. They generally lived in Kowloon after it was ceded in 1860, their identity strengthened by their residential separateness. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=894))
        - **Note**: La Salle College had a lot of Portugese, maybe that's why.
    - English-style homes and villas, clubs, a hotel, a private hospital, an Anglican church, and the Peak Tram, opened in May 1888. Apart from residence, British social status was represented primarily though membership in such elite clubs as the Hong Kong Club, the Cricket Club, the Jockey Club, and the Ladies Recreation Club. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=900))
    - Hong Kong’s non-Chinese population also included many Indians. Among them were Parsee traders, who were some of the first landowners in colonial Hong Kong. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=934))
    - The majority of Hong Kong’s Indians, however, were Muslims and Sikhs who came to Hong Kong as traders, soldiers, and policemen. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=938))
    - According to Hong Kong’s constitution, laid out in the Letters Patent of April 5, 1843, ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=950))
    - In 1856, Bowring suggested that taxpayers (including Chinese) who owned land worth more than ten British pounds should be given the right to elect one member of the Legislative Council. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=959))
    - Because the British selectively incorporated the legal traditions of the people they conquered, as more territories were incorporated the empire inherited a web of legal systems that combined English common law, British statutory law, and local customary law. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=971))
    - the British realized that they could not impose radical changes on areas as large and diverse, ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=974))
    - Christopher Munn ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=979))
    - Hong Kong had one of the largest police forces in the British Empire, a huge military presence, an elaborate system of monopolies and taxes, and oppressive curfews and registration programs for controlling the majority Chinese population. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=983))
    - But the colonial government’s narrow reliance on these China experts and on interpreters and intermediaries in general often created a barrier between the government and its subjects that could cause serious problems. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1036))
    - MacDonnell introduced a wider registration program for managing the Chinese population. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1066))
        - **Note**: ID card system
    - The colonial government did not always have such a free hand. It had to answer to the Colonial Office and the British Parliament, and it was often bound to comply with legislation in other parts of the empire. Nor could it afford to offend the Chinese community. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1138))
    - Contagious Diseases Acts of 1866 ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1154))
    - Toward the end of the nineteenth century, among the European prostitutes were a large number of Jews who had fled the pogroms in Russia. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1184))
    - By the late 1870s, an extensive network of kidnapping had developed to feed the need for prostitutes and servants in Hong Kong. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1203))
    - Although the jubilee reiterated the familiar, self-congratulating themes of British colonialism, it was truly a collaborative affair, for local European, Chinese, Eurasian, and Indian leaders all helped organize the festivities. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1286))
    - In May 1894, Hong Kong was stricken with bubonic plague believed to have originated in Canton, where some one hundred thousand people died. ([Location 1296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1296))
    - Approximately eighty thousand people left Hong Kong during the epidemic. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1303))
    - The Sanitary Board, now given more power, ordered troops to search homes, remove and burn corpses, and isolate plague victims in the Hygeia. Many houses were burned down, leading to massive dislocation. ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1326))
    - The plague of 1894 had several important effects on Hong Kong society. Although some Chinese leaders had helped distribute medicine, many colonial officials and European residents criticized both Chinese medicine and the Tung Wah Hospital. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1329))
    - As the resistance to the government’s plague measures seemed to prove how little the Chinese population understood Western ideas of health and sanitation, Europeans and some Chinese elites demanded more English in schools. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1333))
    - The plague also reaffirmed many Europeans’ conviction that they needed to stay as far away as possible from the Chinese. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1335))
    - The Hong Kong plague was also probably responsible for the one that afflicted India in 1896–1900. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1340))
    - Ironically, the 1894 petition for constitutional reform ended up benefiting the Chinese community more than the European community. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1355))
    - (by the late 1800s, less than 2 percent of Britain’s exports were to China) ([Location 1370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1370))
    - (more than half of China’s foreign trade was already with Britain). ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1372))
    - the U.S. Navy used Mirs Bay—less than twenty miles northeast of Hong Kong—to conduct its operations in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War. ([Location 1380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1380))
    - Villagers feared that the British invaders would impose new taxes, confiscate land, interfere with traditional customs, and disrupt feng shui. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1410))
    - For the most part, wealthy Chinese and Eurasians responded to racial discrimination by creating their own exclusive social world. ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1510))
    - the Chinese Club. ([Location 1521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1521))
    - the Chinese Recreation Club, ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1523))
    - Historians have often stressed Hong Kong’s contributions to China’s nation-building in the late 1800s and early 1900s. ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1529))
    - Although the revolutionaries, eager to keep the foreign powers neutral, discouraged antiforeign sentiments, many Chinese in Hong Kong felt that since the Manchus had been driven out of China, the British should be next. Colonial authorities discovered factories for making bombs, and civil unrest erupted throughout the colony. Crowds looted shops, threw stones at the police and at the governor when he appeared in public, and tried to rescue prisoners in jail. ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1647))
    - In July 1912, a young Chinese man tried to assassinate the new governor, Francis May. ([Location 1652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1652))
    - “unintelligent passion for politics” ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1658))
    - the Hong Kong government had to deal directly with a succession of regimes in Canton, several of which tried to undermine Hong Kong’s political and economic stability. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1677))
    - In November of the same year, Governor May encouraged the Star Ferry Company and the colony’s two tramways to stop accepting Chinese coins. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1685))
    - A weakened Hong Kong economy, they argued, would mean that Hong Kong residents would have less money to help their kin in Guangdong. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1692))
    - The driving force behind the university was Lugard, governor from 1907 to 1912. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1699))
    - Hormusjee Mody, a Parsee merchant who was later knighted for his generosity and his service to the British Crown, offered almost eighteen thousand pounds to start the building and a generous endowment. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1703))
    - “the money-grabbing traders fear that if we educate the Chinaman he may become a serious rival.” ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1708))
    - Ng Li Hing, a local Chinese merchant, donated money for the anatomy building. A Chinese merchant from the Straits Settlements contributed to the arts faculty. The Eurasian Robert Ho Tung later endowed a chair in surgery. Only after Lady Lugard began to canvass their London headquarters, however, did the local British merchant community agree to contribute. Butterfield and Swire made a large donation of forty thousand pounds, mainly to prevent a boycott of their company after one of their ticket collectors had been accused of kicking an elderly Chinese to death. Whereas the Beijing and Canton governments each sent twenty-five thousand pounds, the British government was especially stingy, sending a paltry three hundred pounds to be used for the King Edward VII Scholarships. ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1711))
    - Despite hopes that the university would attract students from the mainland, Japanese universities and those run by American missionaries in China remained far more popular. Only after World War II would the university truly fulfill its potential. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1721))
    - Chinese entrepreneurs benefited from the departure of approximately one-quarter of the colony’s European men for the war front, moving into businesses dominated by Europeans such as banking and shipping. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1727))
    - Chau Siu Ki, ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1738))
    - piracy occurred weekly in Hong Kong waters. In an especially notorious case in 1924, pirates seized a ferry from the island of Cheung Chau en route to Hong Kong. After taking the passengers to a mainland lair, the pirates sent three of the victims’ ears to their relatives in demand for a ransom. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1786))
    - In the absence of a strong central government, some Hong Kong merchants tried to influence Chinese politics in order to protect their business interests on the mainland. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1788))
    - especially during the general instability of the early 1920s, ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1817))
        - **Note**: It is always relative
    - The reason that the colonial government consistently played down Hong Kong’s industry says much about Hong Kong’s historical purpose in the British Empire. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1837))
    - The colony, explains historian John Darwin, was “merely one square on the larger chessboard of Anglo-Chinese relations.” ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1874))
    - maintaining that it violated British policy of conciliating Chinese nationalism. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1878))
    - The Societies Ordinance of 1920 prohibited any society having “unlawful purposes or purposes incompatible with the peace and good order of the Colony.” ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1913))
    - Governor Stubbs mismanaged the strike by overreacting and insisting that it was political and led by agitators in Canton. ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1936))
    - Governor Stubbs and his successor, Clementi, were adamant that the strike was directed by Bolshevik agitators in Canton and their Soviet advisors and had nothing to do with economic or political conditions in the colony. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1975))
    - Under the Peace Preservation Ordinance and the Emergency Ordinance that had been enacted during the 1922 strike, Stubbs declared a state of emergency, mobilizing volunteers and prohibiting the export of foodstuffs and money. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=1997))
    - the Labour Protection Bureau hired thugs and former pirates to protect workers who stayed at their jobs and to intimidate anyone who encouraged the strikers. ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2024))
    - Fighting the strike meant protecting the colony that they had helped fashion from the fabled barren rock and preserving a new way of life that they had helped shape. ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2030))
    - The colonial government made it harder to express antigovernment views by requiring newspapers to pay a security fee. In 1927 the Printers and Publishers Ordinance was revamped to prevent attacks against the colonial administration. The Illegal Strike and Lockout Ordinance of 1927 made strikes illegal if they tried to coerce the government or had any objective beyond a dispute within a certain industry. The government also banned all unions that had been involved in the strike and all politically motivated strikes. Union funds could not be used for political purposes outside of Hong Kong, and no branch of ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2042))
    - The colonial government also tried to use education to curb the growth of radical nationalism in Hong Kong. ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2054))
    - In 1927, Clementi encouraged some of the most distinguished Chinese scholars in Hong Kong—most of whom had left China after the 1911 revolution and during the May Fourth Movement—to promote traditional Chinese culture and morality in Hong Kong, promising to provide government support for a Chinese Department at the University of Hong Kong to train teachers for local schools.

    - The strike hurt Hong Kong’s economy enough to convince the Foreign Office of the need to make concessions to China, which it did by surrendering the concessions at Hankou and Jiujiang in 1927–28 and Weihaiwei in 1930. ([Location 2067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2067))
    - The Foreign Office often criticized Hong Kong governors for trying to interfere with Canton politics, dismissing them as being out of touch with broader British goals in China and with China’s political situation. ([Location 2075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2075))

    - In the 1920s, however, the government began to take a more active role in providing social welfare. This was a gradual process shaped by developments in Britain, China, and Hong Kong. ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2129))
    - Still, the colonial government always tried not to spend too much on social welfare, worrying that more immigrants would pour in from China if conditions in Hong Kong were too good. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2144))
    - The pressure to end licensed prostitution came from three main sources: reformers in Britain, the League of Nations, and a group of local European women. ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2164))
        - **Note**: The hk affair is always affected by a more marco force. What is the macro forces that is affecting hk politics now and what are their agenda?
    - This time, the campaign had help from all sorts of places: British women in Hong Kong, a small group of local Chinese, members of Parliament in Britain, religious leaders (including the archbishops of York and Canterbury), and international women’s groups.

        - **Note**: British is more progressive, hence we will be more progressive. A very colonial mindset
    - Convinced that reforming or abolishing the system would be more harmful than useful, Clementi may have been right: the number of abandoned dead babies and children was 1,851 in 1929, some 300 more than in 1928 and about 700 more than in 1927. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2211))
    - In response to so much pressure, in 1929 the Legislative Council passed an amendment stipulating that mui-tsai were to be registered and paid wages. ([Location 2218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2218))

    - Not only was this an issue of racial discrimination, it was also very costly. In 1914 a European police constable received more than seven times the pay of a local Chinese or Indian constable, while in 1939, the lowest-ranking European policeman received almost eight times the pay of a Chinese of the same rank. ([Location 2237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2237))

    - For the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Hong Kong was a link to the outside world. In January 1938, the colonial government allowed the CCP to establish a local office (disguised as a tea company in order not to violate British neutrality laws) of the Eighth Route Army, which raised donations of medicine and money from overseas Chinese.

    - By late 1942, when the war was going badly for Japan, the governor tried even more vigorously to restrict Hong Kong’s scarce resources for the Japanese troops. In January 1943, the Kempeitai set two German shepherds on a group of Chinese women who had been gathering grass for fuel. Only after the dogs had chewed pieces of flesh out of them were the women released. ([Location 2444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2444))

    - Harry Truman, who became president after Roosevelt died in April 1945, was less committed than his predecessor to restoring Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, while General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, supported outright the continuation of the British Empire in East Asia.

    - Postwar Hong Kong was plagued by the problems that face all societies reeling from the ravages of war: inflation, unemployment, looting, poor health and sanitary conditions, and shortages in currency, housing, personnel, and food (some 80 percent of the population suffered from malnutrition). ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2561))

    - From 1947 to 1949, almost all major firms in Shanghai moved their operations to Hong Kong, which gave the colony larger and more sophisticated factories. ([Location 2679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2679))
    - This strategic usefulness was enhanced by the fact that the cost of retaining Hong Kong was extremely low. After 1948, Hong Kong did not require any financial assistance from Britain, although Britain continued to pay for most of the local garrison. ([Location 2688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2688))

        - **Note**: So now ccp thinks it has mature.
    - The United States needed allies to contain China, and Hong Kong was the ideal place for gathering intelligence, spreading propaganda, and organizing covert action against China. But the British worried that working too closely with the United States and allowing it too much leeway in Hong Kong would provoke the PRC into stirring up trouble in Hong Kong or attacking the colony if war broke out with the United States. ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2803))

    - Ironically, the greatest threat to Hong Kong’s economy in the years after the 1949 revolution came not from the Chinese Communists but rather from the United States—the country most determined to contain the spread of Communism. ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2818))
    - “The classic example,” explained Grantham, “is that of dried ducks. These ducks were processed in Hong Kong and then exported to America. Many of them came from eggs laid in China and brought to Hong Kong to hatch. Were the ducks from these eggs communist ducks or true-blue British ducks? The correspondence on the subject was voluminous before a solution was finally reached. Provided that an inspector was present when the duck was hatched, that he forthwith rubber-stamped the duckling’s foot, and that on reaching maturity a further marking was put on the duck, then the ducks might be slaughtered, dried and admitted into the United States.” ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2823))

    - Rather, the initiative came from local Chinese entrepreneurs, who realized that while smuggling goods into China under the embargoes could be highly lucrative it was risky and unreliable, and from the influx of Chinese entrepreneurs from the mainland. ([Location 2861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=2861))
    - Shek Kip Mei provided an ideal excuse for the colonial government, which, under pressure from the Colonial Office, had wanted to introduce public housing earlier but faced opposition from the Chinese elite.

    - Hong Kong had never experienced anything like the Confrontation (as colonial officials called it) of 1967, but the disturbances, like the Star Ferry riots the previous year, revealed many of the conditions in Hong Kong that provided a favorable environment for civil unrest.

    - It is not hard to see why the leftists never found widespread local support for their cause, especially among a population that included so many people who had fled the Communist government in China and who viewed the Cultural Revolution with horror and revulsion. ([Location 3116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3116))

    - Hong Kong’s economy benefited immensely from the growth of real estate development, led mainly by Chinese entrepreneurs such as Li Ka-shing, an immigrant from Guangdong who had begun his career in plastics and property, as well as from a large influx of foreign investment, especially from Japan and the United States.

    - A sense of local identity had in fact emerged by the late 1800s, when many wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong came to see themselves as permanent residents and as a special kind of Chinese, separate from their counterparts on the mainland. ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3310))
    - Perhaps what most shaped this sense of Hong Kong identity, however, was the realization in the early 1980s that Hong Kong would revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. ([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3316))
    - Hong Kong’s rapid economic development from the early 1970s to the 1980s also led to the rise of a local popular culture expressed in film, music, and television shows. ([Location 3324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3324))

    - From the late 1970s on, Hong Kong and Guangdong became increasingly reintegrated in a symbiotic relationship shaped by Guangdong’s inexpensive labor and land and Hong Kong’s capital and extensive international connections. ([Location 3349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3349))

    - For China, recovering Hong Kong was a way to end the unequal treaties and to reclaim face and honor. For Deng Xiaoping in particular, who saw Hong Kong as part of a larger reunification that included Taiwan and Macau, it was a way to show Taiwan that the one country, two systems mode!—originally meant to apply to Taiwan rather than Hong Kong—could work.

    - As David Wilson, former political advisor to the Hong Kong government (he had accompanied MacLehose to Bejing in 1979) and member of the British negotiating team, recalled, “We had wanted to write a book—which would have looked rather like the Encyclopaedia Britannica —while the Chinese wanted about two or three sides of A4 paper.”19 ([Location 3580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3580))

        - **Note**: The defeatism of Hong Kong people is the very step that we give up our freedom.

    - For the British, the Joint Declaration was an attempt to protect Hong Kong after 1997 and to withdraw with dignity and without appearing as if they had surrendered Hong Kong and betrayed its people. ([Location 3625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3625))
        - **Note**: The hope is gone and the risk has been realized after just 25 years.
    - While some people in Hong Kong reacted to this uncertainty by taking a stronger interest in local politics, others responded by voting with their feet. People had been emigrating from Hong Kong (mainly to Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States) before and throughout the Sino-British negotiations, but the scale and intensity of emigration increased dramatically after the Joint Declaration, when Hong Kong saw a “gathering wave of emigration.” ([Location 3662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3662))

    - The Chinese government argued that Hong Kong should return to China as it stood in 1984, when the joint agreement was signed, but the British and Hong Kong governments insisted that Hong Kong could not be frozen in time for thirteen years. ([Location 3692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3692))
    - Most people in Hong Kong understood that while the Basic Law was the PRC government’s attempt to show Hong Kong people that it was sincere about the one country, two systems model, it was also the government’s way to show that it was in charge of Hong Kong’s post-1997 future. ([Location 3724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=3724))
    - According to a 1988 poll, more than half of the respondents believed that reversion to Chinese rule would hurt civil rights and individual liberty. Almost half said that they trusted the Hong Kong government, about 30 percent said that they trusted the British government, but only about 20 percent said that they trusted the Chinese government.

    - The Bill of Rights, enacted in June 1991, was another part of the British government’s attempt to restore confidence in Hong Kong. The Chinese government opposed the bill from the outset, insisting that it violated the law and the spirit of the Joint Declaration and that the Basic Law already provided sufficient protection.

    - Patten’s proposals led to conflict between Britain and China, but they also represented the desires of many Hong Kong people, which could be seen in the results of the Legislative Council elections of 1995. ([Location 4035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4035))
    - The campaign also showed how many of the same elites who had previously urged the British to try to hold on to Hong Kong changed their allegiance after the Joint Declaration in 1984. ([Location 4071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4071))
        - **Note**: The choice of appeasement
    - Yet the handover had also brought Britain a new sense of prestige and respect. ([Location 4145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4145))
    - A huge diplomatic, national, and psychological victory over the unequal treaties imposed by the Western powers in the mid-1800s, the recovery of Hong Kong was a major event in modern Chinese history. ([Location 4156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4156))
    - denying it the possibility of a third, alternative identity of its own. ([Location 4174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4174))
    - Much of this (albeit guarded) confidence and optimism stemmed from Hong Kong and China’s growing economic interdependence and from China’s economic development, which by the late 1980s had helped make Hong Kong the world’s third-largest financial center (after London and New York). ([Location 4219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4219))
    - The largest investor in China, Hong Kong now handled half of China’s exports and almost 60 percent of its total foreign investment and provided one-third of its foreign exchange reserves. ([Location 4227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4227))
    - The handover also had important implications for relations between China and the United States. In 1992 the U.S. Congress enacted the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, which stipulates that the United States would continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate territory after 1997 as long as the president considers Hong Kong “sufficiently autonomous.” ([Location 4265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4265))
    - Several features made Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese rule in 1997 so distinctive in world history. Not only was it the last significant British colony to decolonize, it was also the most economically successful of British colonies. ([Location 4301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4301))
    - Even while drawing attention to Hong Kong’s uncertain future, the reversion to Chinese sovereignty put the region in the international spotlight in a way that further enhanced its global reputation as a vibrant, cosmopolitan society. ([Location 4371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4371))
    - Rather than a celebration, for many Hong Kong people the anniversary of the reversion to Chinese sovereignty has been a yearly occasion to express their dissatisfaction with the HKSAR government. ([Location 4397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4397))
    - The government was “in closer contact with the real public opinion then than either before or after.” Morale was high and relations between government and people were “excellent,” ([Location 4415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4415))
    - Many Hong Kong people, however, believe that the PRC government has intervened far too regularly in the HKSAR’s political affairs. A major concern is Hong Kong’s legal and political autonomy under the one country, two systems arrangement. ([Location 4448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4448))
    - The problem is that no one is sure how long this press freedom will last or how far its boundaries extend. ([Location 4505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4505))
    - while Hong Kong’s colonial status protected it from many of the troubles that plagued China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. ([Location 4570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4570))
    - its generally efficient and nonpolitical civil service frequently drew praise from the various regimes on the mainland. Under British rule, Hong Kong also achieved a high standard of living for many of its inhabitants. By the early 1990s, Hong Kong’s per capita income had surpassed Britain’s. The region enjoys one of the world’s lowest infant mortality rates and has extremely high life expectancy rates. ([Location 4572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4572))
    - One of the most serious weaknesses of Hong Kong’s post-1997 political system is also a legacy from the colonial period. This weakness, in the words of Lau, is the HKSAR’s “failure to produce political leadership.” ([Location 4677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4677))
    - In the past decade, Hong Kong and Guangdong have become more closely integrated than at any time since the 1949 revolution in China, so much so that anthropologist Gregory Guldin has predicted the emergence of a giant “Pearl River megalopolis” that includes Guangzhou, Macau, Hong Kong, and some smaller mainland cities. ([Location 4728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E2Q79NO&location=4728))
    - For the historian, perhaps the most interesting way in which history figures in the ongoing process of Hong Kong’s reunification with China is the HKSAR government’s effort to use history and heritage preservation to promote a sense of Hong Kong localness and belonging within a larger sense of Chinese nationalism.
