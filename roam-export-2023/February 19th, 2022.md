- [[Theodore]] is coming out earlier than expected!
    - Exciting time!
    - 05:45 [[Wifey]] discovered her water broke.
    - Luckily there was a Taxi when we went down to the street.
    - After a while, we arrived to posternal ward.
    - I was tasked to register, in ER
    - COVID-19 was in 7K cases per day. A lot of newspaper article about how crowded ERs were and a lot of elderlies were outside, cold and wet.
    - Luckily there is not much people in the ER in the morning.
    - Everything is settled at 07:15

    - [[Annuity]] Functions in [[Family [[finance]]]]
        - It is for people to make sense of a how a recurring payment interact with an interest rate.
        - Functions
            - FV (Future Value)
                - FV(rate, nper, pmt, pv, type)
                - The total amount after all payment is done in the RATE (interest rate) across the NPER (Number of Payment) with the PV (Present Value) of TYPE (end? OR !beginning?)
                - Can be used as the goal of your [[Family [[finance]]]]
            - PMT (Payment)
                - Giving a goal (for example, a lump sum of mortgage), AKA FV (Future Value) with the target RATE (interest rate) and NPER (Number of Payment) and a PV (Present Value) of TYPE (end? OR !beginning?), how much amount per payment you need to give out?
            - RATE (interest rate)
            - NPER (Number of Payment)
            - PV (Present Value)
                - Giving a PMT (Payment) throughout a NPER (Number of Payment), with the discount of RATE (interest rate), what does it cost now? 
            - TYPE (end? OR !beginning?)
                - payment is done at the beginning
                - payment is done at the end
                - matters to the amount of interest needed
