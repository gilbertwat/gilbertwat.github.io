- Hi Gilbert, Alia
- I am writing to recommend the promotion of Mohammad to Software Engineer 2.
- Mohammad has worked in Gogovan web team since September 2020 as a Software Engineer 1. He has evolved to be a key member to the team rapidly. He has demonstrated his passion for technologies and consistently exceeding our expectations.
- Mohammad cares about Developer Experience and pays special attention to consistency in code and design. Some of these examples include the usage of nvmrc file for automatically switch our node version depending on the project we are working on.  Developed reusable components such as Page component, Callout component and enhance our existing Button component that directly positively impact our development speed and consistency. Mohammad also took care of date formatting by creating a helper function that would display date and time in a consistent format according to the country. And he had proactively fixed our typography by setting line height in our typography component style.
- Mohammad has joined us recently and has already contributed to critical features in BET such as Additional requirement 2.0, Saved address / Recent address, Signup flow revamp, Order management revamp, Order Detail revamp, integrate NPS survey, add tracking for signup and login and is currently leading the 3DS implementation in GGB.
- Mohammad has played a positive influence on people he works with. He is willing to learn and willing to share. His sharing session about GraphQL was very interesting. Mohammad is strongly helping our software delivery lifecycle by proactively taking code reviews and releases fast. He is as well vocal during scrum events and does not hesitate to ask questions or propose solutions in sprint grooming, sprint planning, and retrospective.
- Mohammad is a great team member to work with. He takes feedback positively, writes quality pull requests, gives quality code review. Therefore, I would like to put my trust on him and recommend promoting him to be Software Engineer 2.
