        - Truth 1 **At least half of our ideas are just not going to work**:
        - Truth #2: **Even the good ideas take several iterations to become viable.**
        - Your ideas are not nearly as important as your process — and the best 
- process starts with understanding what the customers you wish to serve __already__ do to solve their problems today and even more importantly, understanding why.
    - Our goal was not to validate whether the merit of a specific solution 
- but to observe existing customer behaviors and desires as a means of 
- generating new ideas for potential product solutions.
    - Generative research questions are focused on understanding existing behavior.
    - At this early stage, you want to put an __ultra-lightweight implementation __of a product solution in front of your target users to see how they react.
    - Usability test
        - Expectation (about what will happen)
        - Reaction (to what happens)
        - Reflection (on the difference between 1 and 2)
    - continuous discovery
        - But a balance between the two groups — existing and new — is ideal. New 
- users can give you a better understanding of your initial product 
- experience, and existing “power users” can offer you insights that come 
- from living with a product for weeks or months.
    - For the sake of your team — the audience of your research — prioritize making your data easily shareable.
    - we have no choice but to do the hard work of talking to our users in the
    - right way and the even harder work to gain consensus as a product team 
- about their actual jobs to be done.
