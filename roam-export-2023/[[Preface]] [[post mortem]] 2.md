- # Why is it happening?
    - The hosting provider of our wordpress blog has suspended our blog without notifying us. And their support has only responded to our support ticket after 7 hours, way more than what we can afford.
- # Prevention & Mitigation
- ## Short term (< 3months)
    - Source and try out monitoring and alert tools
- ## Long term (> 3 months)
    - Source a more reliable and responsive wordpress provider.
        - Uptime guarantee
        - Response time guarantee
        - And more…etc.
