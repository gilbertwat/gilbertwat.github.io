    - ### To what extent have you achieved your objectives?
        - Gilbert Wat
            - Under COVID-19, engineers are more engaged to deliver best possible software to the market.
            - We are able to make a lot of progress to enable us to ship more complex features with more confidence.
            - The team is more mature to deal with technical challenges together and ship features without hiccup and incidents.
            - I am still not very confident our features can bring positive P&L to our company.
    - ### What should your manager START doing?
        - [[Keith Chan]] (direct report)
            - Build internal/external community to uplift the engineering standards. Make plan to drive engineers to be more collaborative.
        - [[Robert Dong]] (direct report)
            - Nothing I can think of
        - [[Victor Lam]] (direct report)
            - For cross-function collaborations, no matter if issues are able to align or not with other parties, discuss with leads for actionable items. Sometimes things got stuck too long to pull the team.

            - Continue to assist data team by giving technical/project advice.
            - I'm really glad to have him as a coworker during my transition to team lead role as he shared his team management experience with me. He could perhaps do the same for new leaders of data/data-engineering teams.
            - Other things that Gilbert should continue doing:
                - Gilbert has always been active in **sharing his thoughts with other people and source feedback**. E.g. his thoughts on improving team performance and how to put them into action
                - From time to time Gilbert would **share articles on data related topics** on #academy-data channel, which is very helpful for the team to grow and learn
                - Gilbert is always **eager to listen and learn** and I'm
    - amazed by how he created positive dynamics in platform team. Even 
- someone as quiet as Peter Wong started sharing with his teammates.
    - Gilbert is willing to learn about data systems and he would **discuss with data team on what he thinks data team can do better to help the company**, e.g. Gilbert shared his thoughts on improving our data warehousing
    - Also a big thank you for giving me **tips on managing data team** in the past year.

        - PS: If having a session of what learnt or what we can take would be 
- better. As different people have different understanding after the same 
- read. If you want people to know what you want to deliver, need put some
    - context with personal findings.

    - ### What should this person STOP doing?
        - Young D. (manager)
            - Managers have to face many stressful situations and even help team members to relieve their stresses. Sometimes Gilbert reacted emotionally and even his team members were concerned. I hope he can have a better control in the stress and emotions in works.
    - ### What should this person CONTINUE doing?
        - Young D. (manager)
            - Keep taking care of team morale and attrition issues as well.
    - ### List your areas needing improvement.
        - Gilbert Wat (self)
            - I need to be able to resolve work conflicts with a less stressful 
- manner. I need to be able to detach, cut loss and settle scores when 
- appropriate. Persistence can be futile without adjustment in 
- expectation.
    - Also I need to be able to better debug work conflicts by recognizing
    - there is always a human (a.k.a irrational) factor to resolving them.
        - Best I could prevent or avoid those situation by being more 
- attentive to human factors and try to nudge them to the right direction 
- with the right approaches.
    - I need to be able to articulate what is in my mind more accurately 
- verbally and conversationally. I need to learn to collect thoughts and 
- reorganize them timely and communicate the right information to my 
- audience.
    - I also need to be able to call out negative behaviors in a constructive way before the negative influence is affecting us.

            - Try being not too emotional about things disagreed. People always got their points, difficulties, situations.
            - Try being not to having a mindset Engineering team to deliver a solution. The solution comes from an agreement with teams with action items on involved parties.
    - ### How would you rate this person's overall performance?
        - Young D. (manager)
            - Meets expectations
        - Gilbert definitely meets the expectation of people. He built a good trust 
- across teams as a manager and keep encouraging team to focus on 
- deliverable values and outcomes.
    - I only worked with Gilbert for 3 months so it may need more input for the whole year. However, I believe Gilbert has a good potential to influence more area and strong passion for his team and the company. Sometimes it become emotional reaction and a quick judging before more communication. I hope Gilbert can help more attrition between different stakeholders and balance workload and stress for himself and his teams.
