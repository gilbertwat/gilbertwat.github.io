- [[2020]] Recap
    - This year has been tough for everyone in the world. [[GOGOX]] engineering team is not exempted. Thank you all our engineers to keep our engineering standard high, proactively collaborating with each other through slack and zoom, brainstorming new initiatives and solutions with fellow tech teammates in this pandemic.

            - internal efficiency improvements such as additional requirement 2.0, error rate SLO with related alerts and monitoring and better deployment and release process,
