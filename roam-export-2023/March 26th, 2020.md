            - Challenge implicit constraints – Ask “What if?” See if “ORs” can become “ANDs.”
            - Identify unstated assumptions – “Can you help me understand why this is important?” “It sounds like we’re assuming X?”
            - Step up to the whiteboard and summarize/synthesize the main themes of the conversations – “It sounds like we all agree on X, Y, and Z. Is that right?”
            - Play devil’s advocate and challenge predominant POV – “It seems like everyone thinks Y, but X is interesting.”
            - Structure the conversation using a framework or ad-hoc buckets – “It sounds like we’re circling three separate questions A, B, and C. Can we start with A?”
            - Focus the conversation towards its objectives – “What decision are we trying to make?” “What question are we trying to answer?”
            - Highlight what the team is not considering—“This might be crazy, but have we considered X?”
