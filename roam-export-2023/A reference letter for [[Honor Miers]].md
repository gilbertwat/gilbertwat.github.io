- To whom it may concern,

I am writing in strong support of Honor Miers’ application to your program. During her summer internship at my team, Honor demonstrated an exceptional eagerness to learn through meaningful contributions.

Honor showed great initiative by taking on new challenges, such as implementing a web design prototype with guidance. The design is now used by our customers. Her natural curiosity constantly drove her to expand her skills.

Honor also volunteered to take on as a teaching assistant. Honor went above and beyond to help others through Python and chatbot tutorials. Her passion for computer science was evident as she explored new technologies to assist colleagues.

In her last assignment, Honor automated an administrative process through independent research and exploration of potential solutions. Her solution streamlined our discount offering workflows, saving us time and effort.

Honor’s insatiable hunger for knowledge, creativity in problem-solving, and determination to continuously push her abilities make her an outstanding candidate for your program. I have no doubt she will thrive in an academic environment that encourages learning. I highly recommend Honor’s acceptance.

Sincerely,

Gilbert Wat
Director of Technology
