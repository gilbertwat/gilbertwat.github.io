    - I don't understand why the indian QAE cannot complete the build and run once on the machine.
    - After 3 weeks he is able to run the test in 3 weeks time.

    - Agenda
        - We need to be aligned for
        - What problem or pain points we have from sprint planning to release
        - How can we solve them
        - Do we need Scum Master role for it?
        - Will discuss for E2E test collaboration
            - Backend will be fully on BE team. No need QA supports.
            - QA team will focus on frontend App(and Web), mostly App
            - How can we collaborate for E2E test in FE, BE, App, QA teams
    - # Meeting notes
        - We discuss for backend team decoupling release cycle first.
        - In Q4, platform team will be **accountable** for the backend release and incidents.
        - In Q4, platform team will lay the foundation of release separately from app release cycle.
        - The preparation will include
            - User level configurations to enable BE feature to specific users, drivers, couriers for testing
            - No smoke test for every release to speed up release
            - Test in production after each release by platform team members
            - No backward incompatible API changes to prevent incidents because of backward incompatibility
            - Run E2E Postman test to backend API for every task to same as what we are doing for public API now, will include in CI process.
        - Tentatively in 2021 Q1, platform team will release backend services separately.
        - **QA team will treat backend services as a black box.**
        - QA team will work with mobile team to develop on App automation tests.
        - QA team will validate mobile app release for each sprints.
        - Next we discuss scrum process.
        - Nothing need to be changed in scrum process.
        - @Paul Leung put up a list of pain points and feelings in delivery process experienced by QA teammates.
            - Story point is not used to estimate QA efforts
            - Rollover tickets are not properly handled in sprint closing
            - All tickets are moved to Ready for QA in day 8, resulting stress in smoke test.
            - Smoke test and feature test in 2 days is not enough.
            - Sprint meetings are not held properly.
        - @Young D. suggest @Paul Leung to gather data from QA teammates. Feelings are hard to discuss.
        - @Gilbert Wat and @Keith Chan re-iterate we need concrete evidence to find root cause of those feelings. This feeling sharing has been in discussion **for a long time** and **adjustments has been made**. The impact of such adjustments need to be **measured**.
    - # Decisions
        - **API E2E test suite will now iterated by platform team.**
        - **Backend release related compliance procedure will now be handled by delivery manager(@Gilbert Wat).**
        - **Staging defects by QA will always be logged on app side.**
