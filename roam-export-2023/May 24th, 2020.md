        - ACID
            - It is a very broad abstraction of different flavor in database
            - consistency has a wide range of spectrum
            - isolation also has a wide range of spectrum

                    - Alice and Bob start their own transaction of `Post.find(1)`
                    - Alice changes `Post`
                    - Bob changes `PostDetail`

                - Ordering is hard
