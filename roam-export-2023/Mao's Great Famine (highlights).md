- ### Highlights first synced by #Readwise [[August 8th, 2023]]
    - this book shows that at least 45 million people died unnecessarily between 1958 and 1962. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=136))
    - But as the fresh evidence presented in this book demonstrates, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap Forward. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=141))
    - As everyone cut corners in the relentless pursuit of higher output, factories spewed out inferior goods that accumulated uncollected by railway sidings. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=153))
    - Up to 40 per cent of all housing was turned into rubble, as homes were pulled down to create fertiliser, to build canteens, to relocate villagers, to straighten roads, to make room for a better future or simply to punish their occupants. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=160))
    - A ‘perfect’ communist state could not provide enough incentives for people to collaborate, and without some degree of accommodation of the profit motive it would have destroyed itself. No communist regime would have managed to stay in power for so long without constant infringements of the party line. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=205))
    - To romanticise what were often utterly desperate ways of surviving is to see the world in black and white, when in reality collectivisation forced everybody, at one point or another, to make grim moral compromises. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=218))
    - But the ability of people to survive was very much limited by their position in an elaborate social hierarchy which pitted the party against the people. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=233))
    - Mao turns against local cadres who produce inflated targets and promise an imminent transition to communism. He tries to rein in some of the worst abuses of the Great Leap Forward, but continues to push forward with collectivisation. He announces that mistakes ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=282))
    - Even when victory seemed inevitable, Stalin continued to keep Mao at arm’s length. Everything about him seemed suspicious to the Soviet leader. What kind of communist was afraid of workers, Stalin wondered repeatedly, as Mao stopped his army outside Shanghai for weeks on end, unwilling to take on the task of feeding the city? Mao was a peasant, a caveman Marxist, Stalin determined after reading translations of the Chinese leader’s writings, which he dismissed as ‘feudal’. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=329))
    - Mao declared a policy of ‘leaning to one side’, swallowing his pride and seeking a rapprochement with the Soviet Union. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=339))
    - Over several days Mao repeatedly lost his temper as he badgered the planners, accusing them of ‘pouring cold water on the enthusiasm of the people’ ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=561))
        - **Note**: The people such a powerful word with no meaning
    - But rare were those who had the conviction, the courage or the inclination to swim against the tide. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=694))
    - By the summer of 1961 work came to a halt, and in March 1962 the project was abandoned altogether. Total irrigated surface: zero hectares. Cost to the state: 150 million yuan. Number of work days: 600,000. Cost to the people: inestimable. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=775))
    - Regular reviews in endless meetings at all levels bestowed three categories of designation on provinces, cities, counties, communes, factories and even individuals, all on the basis of their achievements. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=924))
    - ‘We knew about the situation, but no one dared to say anything. If you said anything, they would beat you up. What could we do?’28 Another explained: ‘Whatever the government said, we had to follow. If I said something wrong, if what I said was against the general line, then I would be labelled as a rightist. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=995))
    - But in reality a dictatorship never has one dictator only, as many people become willing to scramble for power over the next person above them. The country was full of local hegemons, each trying to deceive the next one up into believing that their achievements were genuine. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1015))
    - Party activists, local cadres and the militia enforced discipline, sometimes punishing underachievers with beatings. At the end of the day, villagers returned to their living quarters, assigned according to each person’s work shift. Meetings followed in the evening to evaluate each worker’s performance and review the local tactics. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1175))
    - A common saying in Guangdong was ‘What you eat is yours, what you don’t is anyone’s.’ ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1207))
    - Afraid that their savings would be confiscated, once parsimonious people started to indulge in conspicuous consumption. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1214))
    - But families who had hoarded their own provisions still failed to turn up. They were denounced as ‘rich peasants’ intent on ‘sabotaging the people’s communes’. The militia then stepped in, patrolling the streets and fining families who had smoke escaping from the chimney. The final step was house-to-house confiscation of food and utensils. ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1239))
    - Model workers peopled party propaganda. He Ding, a poor farmer from Henan who never had a day of schooling in his life, devised a system of wooden earth-carriers moving on overhead cables with an automatic dump-and-return mechanism which reduced the amount of labour needed to build a reservoir by eight times.4 Wooden conveyor belts, wooden threshing machines and wooden rice-planting machines, all were hailed as everyman miracles. In Shaanxi province, villagers even trotted out native cars and locomotives: every part was made of wood.5 Most of these were innocent enough, but the waste could reach huge proportions. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1274))
    - The key to success was small furnaces operated by villagers in every backyard of the people’s communes. Built of sand, stone, fire clay or bricks, they were relatively simple affairs allowing every villager to be mobilised in the effort to overtake Britain. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1303))
    - In the frenzy to achieve targets, accidents were frequent. Trees were randomly felled, keeling over on villagers; explosive devices used by inexperienced workers to open up mines also claimed lives. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1322))
    - Those who failed to show enough enthusiasm were verbally abused, pushed around or even tied up and paraded. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1333))
    - They were cold and poorly fed: local cadres tried to lower the cost of making steel, thus inflating the figures, by skimping on provisions, which were now entirely in their hands thanks to the advent of collective canteens. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1338))
    - But two new dimensions were added to the theatre of violence, nipping in the bud any suspected insubordination. First, cadres could now count on the militia established within the people’s communes to force through their orders. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1344))
    - Second, as all the food was now in the hands of the communes, cadres could use rations as a form of reward or punishment. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1348))
    - The total losses from the iron-and-steel drive in 1958 were later estimated by the Bureau for Statistics at 5 billion yuan – not including damage to buildings, forests, mines and people. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1363))
    - Tan Zhenlin was blunt, addressing some of the leaders of South China in October 1958: ‘You need to fight against the peasants . . . There is something ideologically wrong with you if you are afraid of coercion.’ ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1394))
    - Both came to rely on each other, Zhu providing military skills while Mao excelled at party politics. A wily politician himself, Zhu De knew how to lend support to the Chairman’s vision of a jump forward into communism. ([Location 1579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1579))
    - In East Germany Ulbricht was desperate to stop the flow of people who voted with their feet by escaping to West Germany. He, too, made extravagant claims, announcing at the Fifth Party Congress in 1958 that a socialist society was in the making, as the per-capita quantity of consumer goods would soon ‘catch up and overtake’ that of West Germany, a process envisaged to be completed by 1961.14 ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1595))
        - **Note**: We will see if HK will follow the same pattern to discourage people from leaving.
    - Most of all, clothes became the battlefield where communist supremacy had to be asserted, as products from grey sheeting to cotton prints flooded the market. The cost of exporting goods below economic cost was enormous for a country living on the edge. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1618))
    - As Ye Jizhuang acknowledged at a party conference on foreign trade at the end of 1958, flooding the market with goods below cost had been a disaster, as more had been sold than before but for far less revenue: ‘we really hurt ourselves, we frightened our friends and we awakened our enemies’. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1624))
        - **Note**: Never do the same in the business world.
    - Mao stepped in and recommended vegetarianism as a solution: ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1661))
        - **Note**: WEF
    - Mao had nudged, cajoled and bullied his colleagues into the Great Leap Forward, ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1693))
    - Regions that failed to fulfil their procurement quotas should be reported: ‘This is not ruthless, it’s realistic. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1775))
        - **Note**: Beware on the perception on this ruthless measure.
    - Peng Dehuai, assigned to the north-west group, was outspoken, on several occasions blaming Mao for the direction of the Great Leap Forward: ‘We all have a share of responsibility, including Mao Zedong. The steel target of 10.7 million tonnes was set by Chairman Mao, so how could he escape responsibility?’ ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1827))
    - The Chairman disliked the old marshal intensely. ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1853))
    - Could there be collusion between enemies within the party and revisionists abroad? Was it a coincidence that Khrushchev made his speech precisely when both Peng Dehuai and Zhang Wentian were attacking the Great Leap Forward? ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=1913))
        - **Note**: Paranoia
    - Under constant fire from Mao and his acolytes for his caution, Zhou Xiaozhou, the reluctant leader of Hunan province, had relented and inflated the crop projections in 1958. ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2015))
    - The real damage done to the economy by the recall of all experts was minor, since few civilian specialists worked in agriculture. And even if some industrial projects were delayed by the withdrawal of foreign expertise, the economy, at this stage, was already in deep trouble. ([Location 2090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2090))
    - Mao became so depressed in the summer of 1960 that he took to his bed, seemingly incapable of confronting adverse news.19 He was in retreat, trying to find a way out of the impasse. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2109))
    - Some foreign observers at the time talked about a ruthless blockade of China by the socialist camp,3 but the uncoupling of the economy from the Soviet Union and its allies was entirely initiated by Beijing. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2119))
    - The official version was that China was suffering from ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2122))
    - unprecedented natural catastrophes which had ravaged a great deal of the countryside, and no more foodstuffs could be exported to the Soviet Union. ([Location 2123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2123))
    - China moved away from the socialist bloc not as punishment for the withdrawal of Soviet experts but because it was bankrupt. ([Location 2134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2134))
    - The first contracts were negotiated in Hong Kong at the end of 1960.9 ([Location 2142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2142))
    - Throughout the famine thus far Zhou Enlai had made sure that deliveries of eggs and meat reached Hong Kong every single day. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2154))
    - Cotton and textile products too left for Hong Kong, jumping from HK$217.3 million in 1959 to HK$287 million the following year.13 All in all, Hong Kong was the largest source of foreign currency earned during the famine, producing some US$320 million a year. ([Location 2158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2158))
    - As we have seen, the leadership never hesitated to place the reputation of the country above the needs of the population, ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2170))
    - A furious reply followed from Beijing, pointing out that Tibet and China were not separate entities but constituted one country, throughout which the government relied on the many advantages of the people’s communes to overcome the natural calamities of the previous two years. ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2249))
    - Ten infants, still breathing, had been thrown into the frozen ground ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2280))
    - in Chengguan. ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2280))
    - Only a few months earlier, attentive to the moods of the Chairman, he had smoothed over widespread shortages, claiming that a socialist economy never developed in a straight line, as even the Soviet Union had gone through periods of decrease in grain output. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2369))
        - **Note**: The price of a mistake results in tens of millions of people died.

The CCP is always about themselves in power instead of serving the people. Even "the people" is a newspeak for them.
    - People were starving because of the mistakes made by the party. ([Location 2373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2373))
    - The notion of a surplus, in other words, was a political construct designed to give legitimacy to the extraction of grain from the countryside. ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2408))
    - By the time a pledge reached the level of the region and the province, the amount had been revised upwards several times as a result of peer pressure. A figure very far removed from reality finally landed on the desk of Li Fuchun, the man responsible for planning the economy and setting national production targets. He, in turn, inflated the target according to the latest policy shifts agreed on by the leadership: that new figure was the party’s command. ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2417))
    - Just as his study appeared in print in 1984, a statistical yearbook was published by the National Statistical Bureau in China with a set of historical data covering the famine years. ([Location 2441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2441))
    - The state made a substantial profit by exporting rice for 400 yuan per tonne. ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2539))
    - Another problem with the command economy was that officials on the ground did not always know what they were doing, and they imposed decisions which turned out to be disastrous. ([Location 2549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2549))
    - Neglect was widespread, as incentives to look after livestock were removed once all the animals had been turned over to the people’s communes. ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2669))
    - The fishing industry was also badly damaged by collectivisation, as the equipment was either confiscated or poorly maintained. ([Location 2706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2706))
    - Ploughs, rakes, sickles, hoes, shovels, buckets, baskets, mats, carts and tools of every kind were collectivised, but which collectivity actually owned them? A tug of war began between teams, brigades and communes, with mutual recriminations and random repossessions, the result of which was that in the end nobody really cared. ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2713))
    - Besides the fact that there were few incentives to repair tools that belonged to everybody in general and nobody in particular, other reasons stood in the way of recovery. ([Location 2730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2730))
    - How a production unit was rewarded was determined by the percentage of the quota it managed to fulfil. ([Location 2739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2739))
        - **Note**: Be careful of what metrics we should optimized for.
    - As the supreme goal of the red factory was output, the cost of input was often neglected. ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2748))
    - Sometimes factories cut costs by churning out products without any identifying label. ([Location 2784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=2784))
    - Previously individual hawkers had an intimate knowledge of complex market conditions and efficiently transported the vegetables to key delivery points in the city, but now a clumsy and rigid command economy only compounded the problems caused by famine in the countryside. ([Location 3000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3000))
    - But farmers bought manufactured goods at inflated prices, although they were forced to sell grain and other foodstuffs to the state at rock-bottom prices – often so low that they made a loss, as we have seen. A colossal transfer of wealth took place from the countryside to the cities. ([Location 3022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3022))
    - Plans were drawn up for the systematic destruction of the entire city within ten years. At one point even the Imperial Palace was threatened by the wrecking ball. ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3090))
    - As a rough approximation between 30 and 40 per cent of all houses were turned into rubble. ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3199))
        - **Note**: War cannot do that too.
    - In Sichuan the situation was worse, with families living in toilets or under the eaves of somebody else’s house. ([Location 3205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3205))
    - Most were moved without much planning and generally without compensation. ([Location 3220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3220))
    - Fire had to be borrowed from neighbours. Once started, it was guarded like a precious commodity, as entire villages sank back into a primitive barter economy. ([Location 3314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3314))
    - widespread famine, poor planning and a more general collapse of authority combined to defeat efforts at afforestation. ([Location 3322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3322))
    - In the province as a whole, a tenth of all medium reservoirs were described as completely wasted projects, and they were abandoned halfway through. None of the ten large ones had much of an impact, as they submerged large cultivated surfaces but actually irrigated very little, causing great anger among local people who had been forced to resettle. ([Location 3424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3424))
    - The conclusion was inescapable: despite the huge efforts devoted to irrigation schemes with the forced enlistment of millions of farmers throughout the province, by 1961 less than a million hectares were irrigated, in contrast to the 2 million in 1957. ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3441))
    - But the reversal came too late: insect infestations spread after 1958, ruining a significant proportion of the crop. The biggest damage was done before the harvest, as swarms of locusts would obscure the sky and cover the countryside under a bristling blanket, devouring the crop. ([Location 3550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3550))
    - In the war on nature, different factors thus combined to amplify dramatically what the leadership described as ‘natural catastrophes’. The steel campaign caused deforestation, leading in turn to soil erosion and water loss. Grandiose irrigation schemes further disturbed the ecological balance, worsening the impact of inundations and droughts, both of which were drivers of locusts: drought eliminated all competition, while the heavy rains that followed allowed locusts to hatch more quickly than other insects and take over a mauled landscape. Because sparrows had vanished and pesticides had been misused, the insects descended unopposed on whatever meagre crop the farmers had managed to grow. ([Location 3560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3560))
    - Sometimes ordinary people could eat copiously because they were lucky enough to be looked after by their cadres, who used every political skill to turn their unit into a bastion of abundance in the midst of starvation. ([Location 3657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3657))
    - As famine developed, the survival of an ordinary person came increasingly to depend on the ability to lie, charm, hide, steal, cheat, pilfer, forage, smuggle, slack, trick, manipulate or otherwise outwit the state. ([Location 3674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3674))
    - But no one could navigate the economy on his own. In a nation of gatekeepers, obstacles were everywhere, as anybody could obstruct anybody else, ([Location 3675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3675))
    - But people in the party were in a better position to use the system for their own personal benefit than those outside it. And they showed endless entrepreneurial guile in devising ways to defraud the state. ([Location 3691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3691))
    - These practices permeated the entire country, as a parallel economy was created by travelling representatives sent to circumnavigate the rigid supply system. ([Location 3699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3699))
    - In many other enterprises administrative and operating expenses were added on to the production costs. ([Location 3729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3729))
    - Before they died they sold their offspring, more often than not to couples who could not have children of their own. In Shandong, Yan Xizhi gave away his three daughters, and sold his five-year-old son for fifteen yuan to a man in a neighbouring village. His youngest son, a ten-month-old toddler, was sold to a cadre for a pittance. Wu Jingxi got five yuan for his nine-year-old son from a stranger, a sum which covered the cost of a bowl of rice and two kilos of peanuts. His heartbroken wife, an inquiry discovered, cried so much that her swollen eyes were losing their vision. Wang Weitong, mother of two, sold one of her sons for 1.5 yuan and four steamed dough buns. But many, of course, never found a buyer for their children. ([Location 3862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3862))
    - Then, in March 1959, all savings in state banks were frozen. ([Location 3875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3875))
    - but apathy more often than not governed the factory floor. ([Location 3881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3881))
    - Cadres simply did not have the means to control every worker and punish every disciplinary breach. ([Location 3883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3883))
    - In the conditions of starvation created by the regime, many people had little choice but to ignore customary moral standards and steal as much as they could. ([Location 3900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3900))
    - Opportunity was greatest in the city, but need ruled the countryside, where many farmers had to survive famine by living on their wits. ([Location 3916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3916))
    - Some cadres kept two sets of books, one with the real figures in the village and another with fake numbers for the eyes of grain inspectors. ([Location 3945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3945))
    - Children and the elderly suffered most, for instance when a blind grandmother was robbed of the little rice she had been able to buy with relief coupons in Danyang city. ([Location 3975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3975))
    - Communes, villages, families: all were seething with tension and resentment, as famine increasingly pitted erstwhile neighbours, friends and relatives against each other. ([Location 3983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=3983))
    - And as Mao was often cryptic in his pronouncements, it was prudent to veer to the left rather than stray to the right. ([Location 4002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4002))
    - Some foreign students were less inhibited than their local counterparts, but critical views were widespread in schools around the country – despite repeated campaigns against ‘rightist conservatism’. ([Location 4018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4018))
    - Other scribblers appeared determined to leave behind more permanent traces of their discontent. Messages of opposition were scrawled on toilet walls. In Xingning city one angry hand etched a slogan in a public toilet insulting Mao.12 A lengthy diatribe against the export of food was found on the wall of a toilet in the Nanjing Automobile Factory.13 ([Location 4037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4037))
        - **Note**: Wtf
    - As Hong Kong’s colonial secretary Claude Burgess put it, the refugee problem was one that ‘no country in the world is in practice willing to share with us’. ([Location 4485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4485))
    - And as labour shortages became acute in the rush towards industrialisation, even they were forced to work in the fields and factories, leaving children in minimal care. ([Location 4498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4498))
    - In Hunan, a province which was not among the worst-hit regions, a very clear gap appears among children aged three in 1964, that is born in 1961: there were some 600,000 fewer of them than six-year-olds, although they too must have suffered. ([Location 4681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4681))
    - As women who had never worked in the fields were mobilised in the rush to modernise, they were required to turn up every day at the sound of the bugle, and march off in teams to plough, sow, rake, weed and winnow. ([Location 4694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4694))
    - The statistics they provided – even if classified – could not possibly reflect the reality, and varied from 3 to 4 per cent of women in the countryside just outside Shanghai to one in every five working women in Hunan. ([Location 4737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4737))
    - Proverbs suggested the limits of respect for the elderly in traditional society: ‘With nine sons and twenty-three grandchildren, a man may still have to dig a grave for himself.’ ([Location 4827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4827))
    - As villagers in Macheng complained, the people’s communes left children without their mothers, women without their husbands, and the elderly without relatives:2 these three family bonds were destroyed as the state was substituted for the family. ([Location 4835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4835))
    - In Tongzhou, just outside Beijing, the head of the retirement home systematically stole food and clothes earmarked for the elderly, condemning the inmates to a winter without heating or cotton-padded jackets. ([Location 4844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4844))
    - The elderly slaved day and night, a seventy-year-old going for ten days without any [[sleep]] at all. ([Location 4848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4848))
    - One reason for the extent of the damage was a lack of firefighting equipment. Most of the fire hoses, pumps, extinguishers, sprinklers and other tools had been imported, but foreign purchases were suspended in a drive towards local self-sufficiency. ([Location 4899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4899))
        - **Note**: Not even sth as basic can be produce locally
    - Inexperienced drivers joined an expanding fleet; weight and speed limits were flouted if not denounced as rightist; ([Location 4941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=4941))
        - **Note**: Wtf
    - Even when they were badly treated, the mad had one advantage: like the court jester, they got away with telling the truth. As one survivor from the Xinyang region remembers, only one man dared to mention the famine in his village, walking around all day in a craze, repeating to all and sundry a popular jingle: ‘man eats man, dog eat dog, even rats are so hungry that they nibble away at stones’. Nobody ever bothered him. ([Location 5057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5057))
    - food ran out, the government started promoting new food technologies and substitute foods. Most of these were quite harmless. ([Location 5112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5112))
        - **Note**: Plant based meat?
    - In a commune in Qingyuan – once considered Guangdong’s granary – 40 per cent of the villagers suffered from oedema in 1960. ([Location 5205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5205))
    - The only available food was in the collective canteens, and access to these was controlled by local cadres. Under immense pressure to come up with tangible results, many local officials used food as a weapon. ([Location 5216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5216))
    - Death by execution, like everything else in the planned economy, was a figure, a target to be fulfilled, a table of statistics in which the numbers had to add up: 4,000 should be killed in 1960, he announced. ([Location 5240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5240))
    - A rough death rate of 5 per cent in 1958 and 1962 and 10 per cent a year from 1959 to 1961 would amount to 700,000 deaths from disease and starvation. ([Location 5266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5266))
    - Common criminals like Shen Shanqing were handed a sentence by a people’s tribunal, but prisoners in re-education camps were not subject to any judicial procedures and could be kept indefinitely – until fully ‘re-educated’. ([Location 5283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5283))
    - The death rate was high, but compared to the Soviet Union in the 1930s the incarceration rate was relatively low. This is because comparatively few people actually did time for crime. They were beaten and starved instead. ([Location 5315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5315))
    - Terror and violence were the foundations of the regime. ([Location 5318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5318))
    - Every meaningful incentive to work was destroyed for the cultivator ([Location 5325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5325))
    - In serious cases victims could be strung up and beaten black and blue. ([Location 5341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5341))
    - The extent of the violence is difficult to underestimate: in a province such as Hunan, which did not rank as one of the worst in terms of overall casualties, a report by a central inspection committee addressed to Zhou Enlai at the time noted that people were beaten to death in eighty-two out of eighty-six counties and cities. ([Location 5432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5432))
        - **Note**: This ijs the most CLS chapter I have ever read.
    - The planned economy already reduced people to mere digits on a balance sheet, a resource to be exploited for the greater good, like coal or grain. ([Location 5517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5517))
    - Immediately following the publication of the Statistical Yearbook, Basil Ashton used the official evidence to propose a figure of 30 million premature deaths during the 1958–62 period, when the overall population stood at roughly 650 million. ([Location 5927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00486U2LY&location=5927))
    - In any event, all three organisations – the provincial public security, the provincial party committee and the provincial Statistical Bureau – would have had to rely on units lower down the party hierarchy to compile their reports.
