    - Excerpt
        - Yet even with this improved observability, we can't always see problems right away with our metric reporting and alerting.
- For example, focusing on latency and error rates may not adequately cover all uses of the service that is being migrated.
    - For internal network traffic, egress is only free-of-charge if it remains in a single AZ.
- At the time of writing this blog post, we deliver approximately 100TB on a typical work day for just Git repositories.
    - Though this was a critical and high traffic service, it was a good 
- choice for the first migration because it is a stateless application 
- with only a few external dependencies.
- The first challenge we experienced was the large number of evicted pods,
    - due to memory constraints on our nodes.
- This required multiple changes to requests and limits. We found that 
- with an application that increases its memory utilization over time, low
    - requests (which reserves memory for each pod) and a generous hard limit
    - on utilization was a recipe for node saturation and a high rate of 
- evictions.
    - The first service we migrated started with taking limited traffic 
- internally and we are continuing to use this method to ensure we are 
- meeting our SLOs before committing all traffic to the cluster.
    - The lesson here was while the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) works well 
- in Kubernetes for adapting to increased traffic, it is also important to
    - evaluate workload characteristics and set reserved pod capacity, 
- especially for uneven demand.
    - Takeaways
        - Stateless application is good for migration.
        - Fewer dependencies is good for migration.
