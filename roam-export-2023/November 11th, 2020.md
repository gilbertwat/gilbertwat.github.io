    - [[Excerpts]]
        - MANAGEMENT IS NOT LEADERSHIP.
            - **True management is the act of making the people around you better.** Management is about investing in people, figuring out who they are, what they're good at, what motivates them, and then aligning the work a company has to do with their role and their growth areas.
            - I love investing in people and I love making them better, into the best versions of themselves.
            - Are the people around you growing? Are they taking on more in scope? Are you seeing them change in terms of things they weren’t good at six months ago? Are you pushing your highest performers and watching them explode? Are you helping your lower performers figure out what's not working?
        - DON’T TRY TO CREATE ROBOTS. FOCUS ON MANAGING THE WHAT, NOT THE HOW.
            - __The best managers set expectations at the “what” level, not the “how” level.__
        - GOOD MANAGERS NEVER CREATE A SECOND PATIENT.
            - And **the point is you can’t help anyone if you also become a patient.** So often one of the very basic things you can do is to turn around and leave to go get help.
                - __As a manager, one of the hardest management skills is learning to take care of yourself first. It can feel selfish, especially if you're a giving person. But trust me when I say that unless you are your best self, there's no way you can make other people into their best selves.__
        - SPEND MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO WITH YOUR HIGH PERFORMERS.
            - “**You should be spending the majority of your time with the people who are moving the needle — the folks who are your highest performers and have the potential to change the company**
            - Look back, Look forward
                - Look back:
                    - What did you like about that? What felt good?
                    - What did you hate about it? What didn’t feel good?
                    - What's the most important thing you learned?
                    - Do you want to do more of that type of work, or less?
                    - What do you want to do differently next time?
                - Look forward:
                    - What’s the next challenge?
                    - What's the next big step or career goal you want to reach for?
                    - What type of work do you want to take on, whether it’s a current project in the company or something that might potentially show up in the future?
                - “A lot of these questions are from a strengths-based philosophy of management, the idea being that if you can figure out the alignment between what people love doing and what they're good at, you can find the best version of them,”
            - **As a manager, one of the best things you can do is to take your high-performers and make bets on them, stretching them and seeing what they're made of. Sometimes people are capable of 10X of what you have them working on today. You just have to help them get there.”**
        - SET EXPECTATIONS, BUT KNOW THAT YOU’RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO BRING THE CLARITY.
            - Do people's roles make sense? Do they know how they fit in? How they align to the business? Then the second piece is, do they know what's expected of them? Do they know what success looks like? **80% of the time when I go into a team that's struggling, the answers to those questions is no**.”
            - Be realistic about what you can offer, but remember that it’s BYOC (Bring Your Own Clarity)
                - That realization prompted some tough, expectation-setting conversations. “I had to say, ‘I'm not going to be able to provide you with clarity. **I actually need people who bring their own clarity and structure. And that’s because I don't have a lot of the answers right now**.
            - **When assessing a low performer, the most important set of exercises to run through are: What is this person's job? What is expected of them? Do they know that? And then once they do, do they have the desire and the energy to fix it?** Then you can go to them and clearly explain, ‘Here’s what's expected of you. Here's what you're delivering. And here's the gap,’” she says.
        - DIRECT IS KIND. HAVE THE HARD CONVERSATION — EARLIER THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO.
            - “Usually when you take the direct path and have those conversations with people, what you find on the other side is that they're struggling, they're confused and they don't know why things aren't working — but they also feel like something's not right,”
            - “Spending huge amounts of your time trying to make someone else successful isn't always going to be sustainable, for you or the company. Sometimes it indicates you should think about having a conversation about whether this is the right fit for them.
            - But she’s not about to leave managers without a foothold to reach for. “I recommend looking at this: **How many people have you hired in the last year?** A lot of times, you'll see companies that are doubling, going from 50 to 100, for example. And then you ask, **how many people have left the organization?** In larger organizations, you can aim for 5% or 10% [non-regrettable attrition](https://firstround.com/review/why-this-engineering-leader-thinks-you-shouldnt-aim-for-zero-regrettable-attrition/), but that’s harder in a 20-person organization. **But if it’s zero, then just look at that math. You’re assuming that you’re perfect at hiring, that you have a 100% success rate — which I've never seen before**,” she says.
