- {{[[DONE]]}} [[1:1]] with [[Ben Cheng]] 
    - One of the discussion is about [[missed expectation]] on the salary front for [[Ben Cheng]]. He is asking a 40% increase. Which could be hard for him to reach that goal.
    - I made the [[decision]] to not pop the bubble as [[Wifey]] said from HR perspective it is hard for him to negotiate that in the market.
    - The context is that he is just starting out job hunting process. And I don't think discouraging him in this stage is helpful to 
        - Increase our trust and happiness
        - Increase the probabilities for him to join me.
        - Increase his chance to get a better life
- {{[[DONE]]}} Farewell [[Kether Chau]] #writings
    - In case you don't know, Kether is leaving us today. I would like to share a few words to thank him for contributing to the project flywheel, build 3-4 prototypes to support our product and technology discovery. 
    - We have explored quite a few technology such as [next.js](https://nextjs.org), the most comprehensive and developer friendly framework in modern frontend web development. We have also explored hosted lightweight databases such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/), put it on production and served real customers.
    - More importantly, he has ~hacked~ made use of [playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a E2E web testing framework and built a few web crawlers. We discovered quite a few technical challenges in scaling a web crawlers performance wise and function maintainability. Now we can put those web crawlers in production in higher confidence, in case our business or product needs.
    - He has also experimented on different text search frameworks, such as  [typesense](https://typesense.org/) and [millisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/). We have even experimented the tuning of such framework to met the need of cantonese input. We are now capable to deploy an intelligent text search for Chinese / Cantonese customers and internal users.
    - Once again I want to thank his flexibility and hunger for knowledge, which was crucial to the stage of our project then.
    - I hope this journey is not too bad for Kether and wish him every success in his future endeavor.
    - P.S.: let me know which cryptocurrency to buy. ðŸš€

- [[1:1]] with [[Young]]
    - He tried to amend what damage he has already done to me. He clarified his intention of bringing [[Henry Lee]] and [[Aaron Fan]] onboard as senior manager and be my supervisor.
        - To grow me as a professional manager.
        - He also thinks that [[Henry Lee]] has an experience that should be inspiring to me.
            - That I never know.
    - I choose to logic with him and also clarified there is no bad feeling currently with him personally. 
        - I forgive him because I don't want to create more unnecessary misery in the world.
        - Also because I don't care.
    - I have forgiven him but it won't change the fact I am moving to the next stage.
    - ðŸš© He thinks there is something that didn't need to communicate and explain.
        - [[Managing up]] A sign of fucking up is that your manager is asking why in your managerial decision.
            - It is not about right or wrong with your decision, but about how to deliver the message
    - ðŸš©
