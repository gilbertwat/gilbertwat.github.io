    - {{{[[DONE]]}}}} First meeting of [[Decouple backend service release]]
        - Participants: [[Paul Leung]]
        - To list out the current process in releasing backend services
            - Day 2,4,6,8 in sprint validate with mobile
                - Our stories are combined
            - Day 9-10 smoke test
                - Green light or not in day 10
                - Deployment in day 2 of next sprint
        - To identify difficulties / problem to achieve decoupling deployment with
            - Assumption: The current version of backend services are regressively tested.
            - No E2E test cases to validate new APIs / old APIs with new functionalities."
        - MVP Proposal:
            - New backend story / task include API E2E test cases
                - E2E test suite is build to validate full stack from API Gateway.
                    - POSTman most likely as it is a tool shared by QA and dev. We need to cater both QA and dev.
                - API E2E test cases are discussed and decided among in-theme QA + Backend Dev to ensure feature delivery and customer happiness.
                - Implementation of the test cases can be distributed.
                - Api-Versioning is a **must** for breaking changes
            - New in-sprint validation
                - API E2E test run at 1000 for every day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
                - Notification to backend team Pass / Fail through reporting (Need investigation on how) **__(QA Accountable)__**
            - Success metric:
                - For EVERY theme, for EVERY tickets, QAs can always get what have been changed in API E2E test suite **__(Dev Accountable)__**
                - Notification of report is completed **__(QA Accountable)__**
            - Timeframe:
                - Agreement: End of 2020-08-07
                - Experiment in staging start at: 2020-08-10
                - Review in staging: 2020-08-21
                - Soonest deployment to production if smooth: 2020-09-07

            - Pre devops
                - Output over outcome
                - Individual over team / global ones
                - Line of code
                    - We actually prefer 10 line solution
                    - Refactoring always delete code
                - Velocity
                    - Relative
                    - Team-dependent
                    - Different context --> velocities imncommensurable
                    - team inevitably work to game it
                        - inflate story points
                        - rush to finish story points in the expense of collaboration
                - Utilizaton
                    - "once you get to very high levels of utilizaton, it takes teams exponentially longer to get anything done."

                    - Product delivery lead times
                        - Shorter the better
                    - batch size (deployment frequency)
                        - Smaller the better

                    - Mean time to restore
                        - shorter the better

                        - lower the better
            - Tempo vs Stability
                - Why not both
                    - Statistically proven
                        - Higher change rate, shorter Lead time(product delivery), lower change fail rate and MTTR
                        - 2016 vs 2017 (4 years ago already)
            - Impact of delivery performance on organizational performance
                - organizational performance highly correlated to ROI
                - ROI is regardless economic cycle
                - Software delivery performance
                    - linked to organizational performance
                    - linked to noncommerical performance too
