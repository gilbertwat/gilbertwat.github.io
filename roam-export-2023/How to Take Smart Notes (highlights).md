    - A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=191))
    - Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=201))
    - The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=251))
    - There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257))
    - Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=264))
    - The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=282))
    - predetermined by definition. We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research (cf. Ahrens, 2014, 134f.). ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=283))
    - Writing is not a linear process. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=290))
    - That is why we need a note-taking system that is as comprehensive as GTD, but one that is suitable for the open-ended process of writing, learning and thinking. Enter the slip-box. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=303))
    - he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419))
    - Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=492))
    - Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=505))
    - 1. Make fleeting notes. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=510))
    - 2. Make literature notes. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=516))
    - 3. Make permanent notes. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=520))
    - The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=523))
    - Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=539))
    - After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=548))
    - Turn your notes into a rough draft. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=555))
    - Edit and proofread your manuscript. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=558))
    - we sometimes forget that the handling is as important as the possibilities of the tool itself. If ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=669))
    - An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=705))
    - Focusing on writing also doesn’t mean to stop giving presentations or finding other ways of making your thoughts public. Where else could you get feedback for your ideas? ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=725))
    - But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful (and often overlooked in the beginning). ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=745))
    - The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=766))
    - Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=772))
        - **Note**: Project flywheel
    - everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=793))
    - A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering to the advice to keep a scientific journal. A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writes everything down. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=814))
    - The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=822))
    - The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes as fleeting ones. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=830))
    - a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=840))
    - It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless – unless you do something with them. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=842))
    - Most ideas will not stand the test of time, while others might become the seed for a major project. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=849))
    - Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=922))
    - By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=933))
    - The material will cluster around the questions they returned to most often, so they don’t risk too far of a departure from their interest. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=971))
    - A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=991))
    - Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015). ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=997))
    - They enter the virtuous circle where willpower isn’t needed anymore because they feel like doing it anyway. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1004))
    - Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1012))
    - image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance (Dweck 2006; 2013). ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1013))
    - The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1036))
    - Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1056))
        - **Note**: This is also applicable to changing people's mind. Sometimes ygou need to attack the fundamental belief of the person.
    - According to a widely cited study, the constant interruption of emails and text messages cuts our productivity by about 40% and makes us at least 10 IQ points dumber. ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1073))
    - more than one thing tries to catch your attention, the temptation is great to look at more than one thing at the same time – to multitask. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1087))
        - **Tags**: #[[focus]] #[[mindset]]
    - Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1113))
    - Proofreading, for example, is obviously part of the writing process, but requires a very different state of mind than the attempt to find the right words. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1139))
    - The mental flexibility to be extremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next is just one side of the equation. To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan. One can be the best driver with the quickest reactions, able to adjust flexibly to different street and weather conditions. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1188))
    - The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1202))
    - To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1217))
        - **Note**: #management
    - Because trainees lack the experience to judge a situation correctly and confidently, they need to stick to the rules they were taught, much to the delight of their teachers. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1235))
    - Here, gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1242))
    - It allows you to become better by giving you the opportunity for deliberate practice. The more experience you gain, the more you will be able to rely on your intuition to tell you what to do next. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1253))
    - Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1297))
    - The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1300))
        - **Note**: Similar to writing down to todo list
    - the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1321))
    - Rather, we may solve a crucial problem while we run errands. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1324))
    - By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. That leaves us with much more mental energy that we can direct towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems in question. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1358))
    - How extensive the literature notes should be really depends on the text and what we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. ([Location 1407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1407))
    - Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1441))
    - Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1490))
    - ·    Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read, ·    Make sure we have given a true account of its content ·    Find the relevance of it and make connections. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1495))
    - The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing. It is the practice of looking for the gist and distinguishing it from mere supporting details. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1523))
    - The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is the precondition to thinking critically and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1561))
    - “The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,” Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1581))
    - Learning requires effort, because we have to think to understand and we need to actively retrieve old knowledge to convince our brains to connect it with new ideas as cues. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1618))
    - It does make sense to break down the work into manageable and measurable steps, but pages per day don’t work that well as a unit when you also have to read, do research and think. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1708))
    - Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat). ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1716))
    - Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read. ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1730))
    - Almost all agree nowadays that real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1763))
    - People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food. From the outside, it would make more sense to do one thing at a time, or buy food in bulk and cook for yourself. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1776))
    - By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1807))
    - but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1868))
    - It is about making sure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1869))
    - What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1887))
    - His famous Feynman diagrams are primarily tools to make understanding easier and his lectures are famous because they help students to really understand physics. ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1934))
    - The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to? That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for actively building connections between notes. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1939))
    - Add a note to the slip-box either behind the note you directly refer to or, if you do not follow up on a specific note, just behind the last note in the slip-box. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1956))
    - The first type of links are those on notes that are giving you the overview of a topic. These are notes directly referred to from the index and usually used as an entry point into a topic that has already developed to such a degree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2064))
    - The most common form of reference is plain note-to-note links. They have no function other than indicating a relevant connection between two individual notes. ([Location 2087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2087))
    - Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions – important facilitators for insight. When we realise that we used to accept two contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve. A paradox can be a sign that we haven’t thought thoroughly enough about a problem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm. Finally, oppositions help to shape ideas by providing contrast. Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015). ([Location 2127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2127))
    - Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, stresses the importance of having a broad theoretical toolbox – not to be a good academic, but to have a good, pragmatic grip on reality. ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2162))
    - A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2174))
    - Pay attention to what you want to remember. 2.  Properly encode the information you want to keep. (This includes thinking about suitable cues.) 3.  Practice recall. (Ibid., 31) ([Location 2197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2197))
    - But the reason why Watson and Crick or Kekulé had these insights and not a random person on the street is that they already had spent a very long time thinking hard about the problems, tinkered with other possible solutions and tried countless other ways of looking at the problem. ([Location 2216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2216))
    - Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realization, anyway, but incremental steps toward improvement. Even groundbreaking paradigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in the right direction instead of one big idea. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2236))
    - The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses.” (Zull 2002, 142f) This is one of the reasons why thinking works so much better when we have the very things we think about in front of our eyes. It is in our nature. ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2247))
    - The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. ([Location 2281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2281))
    - Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. ([Location 2284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2284))
    - Often, companies don’t even keep track of their own failed attempts, providing McMath with whole series in which one kind of mistake was made in multiple variations, sometimes from each generation of developers in the same company (McMath and Forbes 1999). ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2322))
    - One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?” (Markman, Lindberg, Kray and Galinsky, 2007). ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2332))
    - Taking simple ideas seriously. ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2340))
    - The next level of understanding is reached when you realise what you buy if you buy a stock: a part of a company. ([Location 2343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2343))
    - But the only thing Warren Buffett thinks about it is the relationship between price and value – he doesn’t even look at the price from yesterday. He understands that simple is not the same as easy, and that the worst thing you can do is to make a simple task unnecessarily complicated. A stock is a share in a company. The price is set by the market, which means by supply and demand, which touches on the rationality of market participants as well as the question of valuation, which means you have to understand something about the business you are considering investing in, including competition, competitive advantages, technological developments, etc. ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2346))
    - Simple ideas can be tied together into consistent theories and build up enormous complexity. This just doesn’t work with complicated ideas. ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2359))
    - Literature is condensed on a note saying, “On page x, it says y,” ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2376))
    - Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there are plenty of studies to back that claim (cf. Stokes 2001; Rheinberger 1997). ([Location 2388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2388))
    - It makes things worse that we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of them, irrespective of their actual relevance (Strack and Mussweiler 1997). ([Location 2444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2444))
    - supervisor: I read so much, but what should I write about? On the other hand, we who have already accompanied our studies by writing and collecting notes in a smart way simply don’t have the need for brainstorming anymore.

    - Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach. ([Location 2478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2478))
    - It is not surprising that motivation is shown to be one of the most important indicators for successful students – next to the feeling of being in control of one’s own learning course. ([Location 2503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2503))
    - These findings are an important argument for academic freedom. Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2508))
    - “When people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice, their energy for subsequent tasks was not diminished. An important question that deserved empirical attention concerns the potential for autonomous choice to vitalise or enhance self-regulatory strength for subsequent tasks.

    - The key is to structure the draft visibly. It is not so much about deciding once and for all what to write in which chapter or paragraph, but what does not need to be written in a particular part of the manuscript. By looking at the (always preliminary) structure, you can see if information will be mentioned in another part. ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2545))
    - The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2602))
    - the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2603))
    - The other lesson is not that we can’t learn from our experiences, but that we can only learn from our experiences if feedback follows shortly afterwards – and maybe more than once in a while. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2609))
    - If we instead set out to write, say, three notes on a specific day, review one paragraph we wrote the day before or check all the literature we discovered in an article, we know exactly at the end of the day what we were able to accomplish and can adjust our expectations for the next day. ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2618))
    - If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started. Rituals help, too (Currey 2013). ([Location 2629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2629))
    - The most reliable predictor of our behaviour in the immediate future is – surprise, surprise – the intention to do it. If we decide to go to the gym now, the chance is that we really do go to the gym now. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2662))
    - The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones. ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2678))
    - Watching others reading books and doing nothing other than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that will end up nowhere will soon be a painful sight. ([Location 2684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2684))
    - First of all, the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one’s own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised. Teaching is still set up for review, and students are not really encouraged to independently build a network of connections between heterogeneous information – despite the radical change in our understanding on how our memory and learning works.
