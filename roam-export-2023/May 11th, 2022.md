                    - Mix and match the current tools we are using.
                    - Data, data, data.
                        - I understand our hunch may be mostly correct but with a data-informed decisions we can be more confident that we are going towards the same direction.
            - Q&A??
            - Lastly: 1 x (1 + 1%)^365 ~= 37.78. Improve everyday together. ðŸ’ª
