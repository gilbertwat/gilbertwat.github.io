    - Simple calculation on default alive for preface new digital product [[[[Preface]] 2.0: credit system]]
        - Minimal head count cost 4 engineers + 1 designer + 2 content creators + 1 marketing/product/sales
            - {{calc: 30000 * 8}} HKD
        - 1 nomad costs 
            - 350 HKD
        - 1 credit : 
            - 500 HKD
        - If we go for the route of 1 on 1
            - 1 subscriber: 1000 / month
            - 1 class: 2 credits = {{calc: 500 *  (1 / 7.78) * 2}} USD
                - {{calc: ((oqDbuMp01)) * 2}}
            - profit of 1 class without headcount cost =
                - {{calc: ((12sWe4Fcc)) - ((5NDv94kKj))}} HKD
            - 1 normal customers will spend 2 credits per month
            - Break even:
                - {{calc: ((WbjzAtG5I)) / ((_yHUajMA8))}} classes
                - 610 customers
            - **We need ~700 customers in 1 city to break even**
        - If we got for the route of group class for corporate training
            - Assume the average credits bought per month:
                - 10
            - Assume class sizes
                - 5
            - profit of 1 class
                - {{calc: ((xz_tuHQvH)) * ((oqDbuMp01)) * 2 - ((5NDv94kKj))}} HKD
            - Break even
                - {{calc: ((WbjzAtG5I)) / (((cOvofmLya)))}}
            - **We need ~60 customers in 1 city to break even**

    - Interview
        - Verdict
            - Parked because there could be a large gap in communication with her and her ability to take technical feedback
        - Self introduction
            - ✅Definitely passionate
            - ✅Definitely candid
            - ✅Definitely strong minded and know what she wants
            - ✅Super appreciated that she switched to English while we are conducting our interview, could be better if she asked us before head. (Note: not okay for Ben)
        - Technical part
            - ✅She built some AI systems to recommend courses for students
            - ❌That's where the orange flag for both me and Ben is up, she is struggle with some basic javascript stuff, despite she said she used javascript for development
            - ❌Also another orange flag, potentially red flag is that she doesn't seek help from us when struggling even after some nudge and hint.
            - ❌Another yellow flag is it seems we switch a few communication styles and wordings and it seems she doesn't get those
            - ❌Failed to appreciate the complexity of choosing a programming language (Her words, "To me is just a tool." Which is fine if she supplemented with pros and cons of different languages she is exposed to)
        - Q&A part
            - ✅Definitely ask a lot of questions
            - ✅Definitely ask hard questions such as why we are not using some off the shelf e-class systems
            - ❌Seems does not convinced that we need to build our own e-class systems (innovation, ownership of core technology of the company)
            - ❌Seems does not appreciate the complexity of building a machine learning system (Her words again, "Just trial and error") despite winning a competition
