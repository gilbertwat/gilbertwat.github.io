- New insight on #[[Analyzing risk]]
    - Timeline is very important for understanding risks
        - For example:
            - It is super risky if you look at the 1H graph of BTC/USD
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FIndieHacker%2Fz0kDCNHnBN.png?alt=media&token=d4415857-2e29-4a03-a85d-15e52a7f4ae8)
                - It fluctuates from 57000 -> 50000 -> 56000
            - But if you look at another graph
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FIndieHacker%2Fb7RyvLTJr3.png?alt=media&token=865b6e85-076b-414a-aaa3-32b5fdcec7d7)
                - It is not at all volatile. it is only keep rising and rising.
        - When are you in the market and in what timeframe you are looking at is very important.

    - Excerpt
        - Since you couldn't afford to hire people, you also had to be versatile. You not only had to design your product, but fabricate it, package it, price it, sell it, keep the books, write the ads, and sweep up at the end of the day.
        - Then he went at it with a vengeance, spending countless hours in the lab. I must say that at the out­ set he had more energy than finesse, but as time went on he developed into a first-rate designer.
        - But just having an idea is not enough. It must pass close examination before it is accepted for special development. It must be practical, it must fill a need, and it must provide an economical solution to that need. Even after passing all tests, the idea is given a priority classification, depending on an appraisal of just how significant a contribution it will make.
        - As an example, HP's unique frequency synthesizer, introduced in 1963, was just an idea in 1958. It was given top priority, and after 50 man-years of research and development it became a marketable new product
        - People have asked me, in view of HP's immense success, whether Dave and Bill were born business­ men. I'd have to say no, but at the same time I'd point out that they had the knack-and still have it-of learning what they needed to know, of taking on a new job and tackling it with all kinds of deter­ mination and enthusiasm. This is contagious. It af­ fects the people around them and is the true essence of leadership.3
        - Such attention to quality has given HP instruments a reputa­tion for reliability and for performing better than their published specifications. HP designers place a high premium on the concept of "human engineer­ ing." Instruments are styled to provide not only an attractive appearance, but to offer the user the ulti· mate in operating ease and convenience.
        - But the company __is __closely knit-not geographically, not by product interests or markets, perhaps­ but by common commitments. There is, for example, the commitment to produce instruments of the high­est quality and value. There is a commitment to enter new fields of measurement where HP can make meaningful contributions. And there is a commit­ment to grow physically by intelligent direction.
        - The total market for industrial and commercial products can be divided into three basic groups of buyers: research and development laboratories; product manufacturers; and service and mainte· nance people. Occasionally, a single customer falls into all three categories. as in the case of the giant American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
        - Another way to break down HP's total market is by industry. From this standpoinl, the electronics industry continues to be of major importance with such big instrument purchasers as GE, Lilton, Sperry-Rand, RCA, Collins Radio. and IBM
        - HP is also a big supplier to the aerospace indus­try, where names like Lockheed, North American Avialion, General Dynamics, and Hughes Aircraft stand out.
        - The stock purchase plan and the retirement plan enable HP people to share in the company’s success and build financial security. In the stock purchase plan, an employee can have an amount deducted from his paycheck (up to 6 percent of base pay) for the purchase of Hewlett-Packard common shares. The company contributes 25 percent of the purchase price.
        - The existence of pleasant working conditions, generous benefit programs, and ample opportunities for individual growth places a definite and continu­ing responsibility on each HP employee. It is a responsibility to contribute, day in and day out, a job performance consistent with the standards of excellence associated with the Hewlett-Packard name.
        - Behind all of these acquisitions and affiliations of the past ten years there has been a well-defined objective to which Hewlett-Packard is firmly dedicated. Stated briefly, it is that “growth should be directed toward building strength for the future, limited on the one hand by the rate of growth which can be financed by conservative measures, and on the other hand by the rate at which we can build our product line and markets through customer acceptance.”
        - This responsibility, this obligation to excellence, carries over into the personal lives of HP people. Extensive participation in civic affairs, generous giving of time and money to community activities, leadership in professional societies-these are a few of the ways they manifest their commitment to good citizenship. Among the people of Hewlett Packard, the urgency of making significant contributions ex­ tends far beyond the bounds of plant, laboratory, and office.
        - A plan is presently under development, for ex­ ample, which will provide greater autonomy within individual geographic sales regions. Field and staff engineers will be backed by teams of specialists in medical, nuclear, chemical, and other scientific disciplines who can offer immediate, on-the.spot consultation to customers regarding the application of highly specialized HP instrumentation.
        - Industry’s advance toward more complete automation of routine and repetitive tasks of production is another promising area for Hewlett-Packard. As more and better sensors are developed, and as the necessary computers become cheaper and more reliable, the automatic factory will become a reality. New test and measuring instruments, capable of being integrated into these systems, will have to be developed.
        - All in all, it promises to be an exciting tomorrow -a tomorrow destined to offer vast and untapped opportunity for Hewlett·Packard men and women throughout the world.
