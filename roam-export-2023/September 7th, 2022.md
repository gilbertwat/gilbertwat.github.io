        - I have a sad news to share. Ken will be leaving the team effectively today

In the meantime, we will be sourcing UI/UX talents to fill in the talent gap and the interim solution is that Anna, Ben and I will takeover our digital UI/UX duty

I am learning so much in this journey. Thank you for your support and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me.

        - 上個星期五之後，我見唔到我同你可以係Preface UI/UX design上有一個有建設性嘅合作。所以我決定由今日開始，終止公司同你嘅合作。公司會根據contract 同勞工例安排番你應得嘅野。你重有冇其他問題？冇嘅話People team 會接手。
    - 17:15 - {{[[DONE]]}}  to tech team
        - I have a news to announce. Ken will be leaving us today.

In the meantime, the UI/UX duty will be shared among Anna, Ben and me. If you have any question feel free to come directly to me.

        - 17:00 - Talk to [[Ken Chow]] with People team
        - 17:15 - Talk to the tech team
    - Expected questions:
        - Why is he leaving?
            - Under performance in these 2 months and incompatible work ethics contribute to our decision.
        - What took the leaders so long?
            - Previously I was aware of Ken's assigned tasks were not his expertise, hence his performance was not satisfying but understandable. Since two months ago, I am more than willing to focus his scope in his supposed expertise of digital UI/UX.

I have drafted a job description for his position and tried my best to collaborate and guide him towards an acceptable standard of UI/UX. Unfortunately during this two month, not only his quality of work is sub-par, I discovered that his work ethics is unacceptable in our workplace and I have to let go of him.
        - So what is work ethic cause it is very subjective? What is work ethnic vs culture?
            - My definition of work ethic is very simple. 

**Treating people with respect and put 100% effort in their work for at least 40 hours per week.**

Some examples of bad work ethics include:
  - When someone is giving feedback, either shush away with contempt or answering with unproductive comments.
  - Finger pointing when failure happens.
  - No acknowledgement is received from messaging or email.

Moving to culture. It is some special ways that Preface is collaborating and solving problems. I am stressing here you are all culture fit here. If you are not culture fitting, you cannot fully perform and improve every day. Culture is also shifting and easily misunderstood, please work with me and Vegas on bringing awareness, commenting and improving our culture.
        - Why sometimes you praise his work and now you let him go?
            - I am trying to communicate my standard to him. He has glimpse of improvement but the improvement is too unsustainable.

If UI/UX is not reliable, I have to protect the team to perform in our best since a lot of your work depends on UI/UX.
