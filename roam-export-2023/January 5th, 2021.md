- {{[[DONE]]}} [[Announcement]] [[Victor Lam]] resignation
    - I got an unfortunate news to share with everyone. Our platform team lead [[Victor Lam]]is going to leave our company for a very brave endeavor🚢. I am so grateful that he leads platform team with such personalized touch and led to tremendous technical advancement on platform and overall product engineering. He led the team to split into different focus area, deploy new coding standards and tools (DDD, Monad, FP, Kafka, Kubernetes, Newrelics dashboard just to name a few) so that our services can be more maintainable and scalable. He is also a great partner of me, sharing honest feedbacks with me. We push each other further through this journey. Thank you again Victor! 🙇🏻‍♂️
