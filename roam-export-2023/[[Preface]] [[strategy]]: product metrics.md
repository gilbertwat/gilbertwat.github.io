- #learning I should do this before building our [[[[Preface]] data warehouse]]
- 
- Preparation
    - Why?
        - Data team did a lot of analytics in the past year. Kudos for being data-driven.
            - To improve upon them, we need a global view of our product health.
        - Discussion about quality of services is very heated and essential. We need to have a data / product point of view to guide our discussion and decision.
            - Enable our team to debate and decide without our guidance.
        - Lingering decisions will lead to a stagnation of growth.
            - Teammates unable to make decision without our helicopter parenting.
    - What?
        - Proposal on the global view of product health
            - Nothing should be new, but we can focus on these metrics
            - Conversion Rate (Sales/Marketing effort, Courses)
                - Suggested Formula:
                    - 
                - Measurement of [[product market fit]], Course student fit in our case
                - Courses Types
                    - Tutorial: Content x Nomad
                    - Teaser(Symposium, Bootcamp, Hackathon, X & Learn ...etc.): Location x Format x Nomad x Schedule x Content
                    - Techbite: Content x Format
            - Mean repurchase lead time
                - Measurement of our educational effectiveness and/or educational satisfaction
                - Measurement of [[product market fit]] too
            - Increment of contact / month (People who gives us their phone number and email)
                - Measurement of brand trust and qualified leads
            - Number of reviews received / month / number of customers
                - Measurement of how much our customers care us.
        - The criteria of this updated set of metrics
            - of business critical.
            - Should be a leading indicator of our business performance
            - Cover the whole customer journey
            - can drive a coordinated actions among departments
            - Measure our quality of services
    - Suggestion on how to use them?
        - Conversion Rate (Sales/Marketing effort, Courses)
            - Improve to a certain level, then perform abnormally detection, tune if needed
            - Constant monitoring in leadership meeting
        - Mean repurchase lead time
            - Improve to a certain level, then perform abnormally detection, tune if needed
            - Constant monitoring in leadership meeting
        - Increment of contact / month (People who gives us their phone number and email)
            - Improve to a certain level, then perform abnormally detection, tune if needed
            - Constant monitoring in leadership meeting
        - Number of reviews received / month / number of customers
            - Improve to a certain level, then perform abnormally detection, tune if needed
            - Constant monitoring in leadership meeting
    - How tech team will collect those?
        - Conversion Rate (Sales/Marketing effort, Courses)
            - Tech team don't have now, but I am sure we have it in Sales / Marketing team.
            - For each campaign we will store this in our data warehouse
        - Mean repurchase lead time
            - is totally measurable now through data warehouse
        - Increment of contact / month (People who gives us their phone number and email)
            - measurable now through our lead database in our data warehouse
        - Number of reviews received / month / number of customers
            - will need a portal support / google form support
    - What about other metrics?
        - I suggest all other metrics is a metrics that is somewhat correlated with the above metrics.
            - We can test the correlation by running experiments on them.
            - But by intuition can be a way too to save time.
    - What about LTV CAC ...etc.?
        - I suggest we measure those when we are in a subscription model.
            - Switching to it requires a lot of things imo.
    - What about Plus Membership?
        - I suggest we focus on improving our course x student fit as the success of this is relying on it.
        - We are too early to do any meaningful metrics since it is the first year of us.
        - Still we can measure retention & adoption rate among our customers.
