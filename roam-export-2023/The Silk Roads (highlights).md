    - But, put simply, the precious-metal supply that had provided a common currency linking one side of the known world with the other – albeit not always in standard unit, weight or fineness – broke down and failed: there was not enough money to go round. 96 ([Location 4104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=4104))
    - Tolerance was a staple feature of a society that was self-assured and confident of its own identity – which was more than could be said for the Christian world where bigotry and religious fundamentalism were rapidly becoming defining features. ([Location 4138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=4138))
    - The aim was to starve the rebel provinces and cities of oxygen and force them into submission. As is so often the case when sanctions are put in place, the result was the opposite: faced with little alternative, the separatists went on the offensive. The only way to survive was to use every ounce of knowledge, skill and expertise they had to their advantage; it was time to turn the tables. ([Location 5128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5128))
    - When the blockade was finally lifted in 1590, the Dutch moved quickly to clear out Spanish troops who had been sent to maintain order, taking advantage of the fact that Philip II of Spain had become embroiled in military conflict elsewhere in Europe. Suddenly free from military pressure and with a window of opportunity presenting itself, the Dutch threw themselves into international trade, seeking to build connections with the Americas, Africa and Asia. ([Location 5137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5137))
    - The Spanish were outraged; they renewed their military action and imposed another blockade. According to the brilliant philosopher and lawyer Hugo Grotius, this simply reinforced the point that the Dutch had to take their destiny into their own hands. Rather than step back in the face of threats and pressure, the only choice was to invest yet more in commercial ventures and build a trade network as quickly as possible to help build up firepower and reinforce independence. It was a question of all or nothing. 43 ([Location 5152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5152))
    - Authors like Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, secretary to the archbishop of Goa, who spent his time thoroughly researching trade routes, harbours, markets and local conditions across Asia, produced texts such as the Itinerario, which provided comprehensive blueprints that served almost as instruction manuals for those setting out for the east. ([Location 5163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5163))
    - The underlying secret to Dutch success in the seventeenth century was common sense and hard work. The Dutch reckoned that the way to work was not to follow the example of England, where the chartered companies used sharp practices to limit beneficiaries to a small circle of intimates, all looking after each other’s interests and using monopoly practices to protect their positions. Instead, capital was pooled and risks shared among as wide a body of investors as possible. In due course, the conclusion was reached that despite competing ambitions and rivalries between provinces, cities and indeed individual merchants, the most efficient and powerful way to build up trade was by combining resources. 49 ([Location 5176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5176))
    - With demand increasing for objects that helped show status, the arts in general in the Netherlands flourished. Some have suggested that 3 million paintings were produced in the seventeenth century alone. 57 ([Location 5218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5218))
    - The traditionally built craft that had sailed across the Indian and Arabian seas for centuries with little change to their design were no match for western vessels that could outmanoeuvre and outgun them at will. Continuous improvements in ship design that made them faster, stronger and more deadly widened the gulf ever further. ([Location 5260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5260))
    - The third and no less important observation was how the navy functioned as an institution. In order to become a lieutenant, it became necessary to spend three years at sea and to pass an exam conducted by superior officers. Subsequent promotions were based strictly on ability rather than on patronage, which meant not only that the ablest rose to the top, but that they did so with the endorsement of their peers. The incentivising transparency of this meritocratic system was further enhanced by a system that rewarded those who had served for longest in the most important capacities. ([Location 5440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5440))
        - **Note**: Reference for our process
    - This made promotion highly desirable and lucrative, which again served to propel the most able to the top, especially as the process was overseen by the Admiralty board, whose aim was to filter out favouritism and partiality. ([Location 5446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5446))
    - After desperate consultation, the government in London concluded that the EIC was too big to fail and agreed a bail-out. To fund this, however, cash had to be raised. Eyes turned to the colonies in North America, where taxes were substantially lower than in Britain itself. ([Location 5632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5632))
    - If Bengalis could starve to death, why not those living in the colonies, whose rights seemed no better or greater? It was time to go it alone. ([Location 5652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5652))
    - The American War of Independence provoked much soul-searching in Britain as to how it should treat the regions where it had built up trading positions that were not just commercially lucrative but had real political clout too. The effective conquest of Bengal marked a signal moment in so far as it changed Britain from being a country that supported colonies of its own émigrés to becoming a domain that ruled other peoples. ([Location 5653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5653))
    - And in that sense, the appointment of Lord Cornwallis as governor-general of India was an eye-opener: it was Cornwallis who had played a prominent role in the debacle across the Atlantic and who had surrendered Yorktown to George Washington. ([Location 5664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5664))
    - The realities of trying to retain and hold on to territories scattered across the globe led to dangerous games of brinkmanship being played with local and global rivals, with increasingly high stakes. ([Location 5676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=5676))
    - Ironically of course, the sense of German menace was itself underpinned by the vulnerability felt by this middle European nation as it faced the possibility of being caught in the middle of a Franco-Russia alliance which talked of military co-operation and joint attack in the event of provocation. ([Location 6269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6269))
    - Not only was Germany given an embarrassing public lesson that its political reach was severely limited, but to make matters worse Berlin saw a heavy fall in the stock market: ([Location 6289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6289))
    - A dangerous siege mentality was building up in Germany, alongside an acute sense that Berlin had powerful enemies and was at their mercy. ([Location 6302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6302))
    - Employees at the Ford Motor Co. in the United States were celebrating the doubling of their wages in January, the result of rising sales and innovative attempts to encourage an increase in production. ([Location 6357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6357))
    - Although he saw that coal underpinned the empire’s success, it was oil on which much depended. ‘If we cannot get oil,’ he told Parliament in July 1913, ‘we cannot get corn, we cannot get cotton and we cannot get a thousand and one commodities necessary for the preservation of the economic energies of Great Britain.’ ([Location 6719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6719))
    - Despite the many different climates, ecosystems and resources it encompassed, there was one obvious lack: oil. ([Location 6832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6832))
        - **Note**: Even an empire is affected by the advancement of tech.
    - The British just needed any leader on whom they could effectively impress the benefits of co-operation with the occupying force; naturally, this would involve bribing them handsomely. ([Location 6883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6883))
        - **Note**: Even the British model will failed.
    - Concerns had been growing about the rising levels of Jewish immigration to Britain, with the numbers arriving from Russia alone rising by a factor of five between 1880 and 1920. ([Location 6911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6911))
    - ‘Organise your lives as you choose, and without any obstacles,’ Lenin declared. ‘You have the right to do so. Know that your rights, like those of all the peoples of Russia, are protected by the full power of the revolution and its agencies.’ ([Location 6977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=6977))
        - **Note**: So on9
    - This mismatch between ambition and ability was a recipe for disaster – a predicament made worse by the obduracy of senior diplomats. ([Location 7089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7089))
    - In the eyes of the British, the contract agreed three decades earlier should stand, no matter what. It was true that considerable financial risks had been taken to open up the oil business in the first place, and that it had required hefty investment to create an infrastructure that enabled resources to be exploited. ([Location 7145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7145))
        - **Note**: When contract is not backed by force.
    - The reality, however, was that the tide had already turned. The power and influence of the west was in decline – and seemed certain to diminish further. There was a price to pay for constant interference in local affairs; there was a price to pay for remodelling the gardens of the embassy; and there was a price to pay for never quite playing with a straight bat. That price was reservation, misgivings and mistrust. ([Location 7174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7174))
    - As Hitler saw it, ‘only a nation whose upper levels are destroyed can be pushed into the ranks of slavery’. As such, officers and leading figures were targeted – by those who knew what they were looking for: fifteen of the twenty-five commanders of the squads instructed to seek out and annihilate ‘the upper levels of society’ had doctorates, mostly in law or philosophy. 37 ([Location 7345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7345))
    - Admiration for Germany across the region went much further. Some scholars have pointed out the similarities between the ideology that Hitler imposed on Germany in the 1930s and a similar programme adopted in Persia of ‘purification’ of the Persian language and customs, and a conscious effort to hark back – as the Nazis did – to a semi-mythical golden age. ([Location 7396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7396))
    - There was an urgent reality behind comments like these, for Germany found itself running increasingly short of food and supplies – with shipments of Soviet grain failing to reduce chronic problems of supply. ([Location 7492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7492))
    - The effect on those living in the ‘deficit’ zone was also noted at the meeting. They were to be cut off at a stroke. In one of the most chilling documents in history, the minutes simply state: ‘as a result, x million people will doubtlessly starve, if that which is necessary for us is extracted from the land’. 73 These deaths were the price to pay for Germany being able to feed itself. These millions were collateral damage, necessary victims for German success and survival. ([Location 7516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7516))
    - In fact, the amounts of grain shipped back to Germany after Operation Barbarossa got under way were much lower than had been imported from the Soviet Union in 1939–41. ([Location 7799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=7799))
        - **Note**: When the illusion of control get better off
    - Britain was the architect of all Iran’s problems and could not be trusted. It considered only its own interests and was imperialist in the worst sense of the word. ([Location 8293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=8293))
    - Money was spent liberally elsewhere. According to one eyewitness, the flood of American currency into Teheran was so great that the value of the dollar relative to the rial fell by nearly 40 per cent during the summer of 1953. Some of these funds were spent paying for crowds to march on the streets of the capital, organised by the CIA’s two main local operatives. ([Location 8354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=8354))
    - His flight to Rome demonstrated a worrying lack of backbone. ([Location 8399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=8399))
    - Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were delighted to be awarded soft loans to buy Soviet weapons and to have highly qualified advisers and technicians dispatched from Moscow to build installations that might prove useful to their wider strategic ambitions. These included the deep-water port at Umm Qasr on the Persian Gulf, but also six military airfields in Iraq, which US intelligence quickly realised could be used ‘to support a Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean’. ([Location 8811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=8811))
    - The impact of the conflict shook the globe. In the US, the military-alert level was raised to DEFCON 3, indicating that the risk of a nuclear launch was considered to be imminent – and higher than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. ([Location 8906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=8906))
        - **Note**: If people can prevail and the looming of a nuclear war doesn't stop people from investing and building company, the current situation we should not be afraid.
    - It was a regime that was stable and, as such, one the British could do business with. ([Location 9082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9082))
    - He was a brilliant communicator, able to capture the mood just as Mossadegh had done three decades earlier. ([Location 9116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9116))
    - Ahmad Mogharebi, ([Location 9168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9168))
    - Sites were built at Qitai and Korla in Xinjiang by the Office of Sigint (Signals Intelligence) Operations, with the new facilities operated by the Technical Department of the General Staff of the People’s Liberation Army of China working closely with US advisers and technicians. 17 Close co-operation between US and Chinese military and intelligence was a by-product of the fall of the Shah. ([Location 9238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9238))
        - **Note**: TIL US failure in Iran is a reason for China's rise.
    - It took decades for the price of this deal to become apparent. ([Location 9289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9289))
    - Saddam was also driven by a heavy dose of insecurity and a strong streak of megalomania. ([Location 9445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9445))
    - Feeling increasingly isolated, he was prepared to turn away from his Soviet backers, who had stood square behind his rise to power in the 1970s. His disillusion was one reason why the Soviets were not told of the forthcoming attack until the day before it was launched – which resulted in a frosty response from Moscow. ([Location 9470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9470))
        - **Note**: When insecured leader is pushed to a corner, he will act irrationnally.
    - Iran was indeed proving resourceful, resurgent – and increasingly ambitious. ([Location 9515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9515))
    - Despite its organisational incoherence, resistance to the Soviet military juggernaut proved nagging, constant and demoralising. ([Location 9587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9587))
    - Men like Osama bin Laden – well connected, articulate and personally impressive – were perfectly placed to act as conduits for large sums of money given by Saudi benefactors; inevitably, their access to these resources in turn built them into important figures within the Mujahidin movement itself. 113 ([Location 9618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9618))
    - The siege mentality had developed into paranoia so acute that, no matter what step the Americans took, it was liable to be misinterpreted. ([Location 9774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9774))
    - From Saddam’s point of view, this was a case of history repeating itself: the US promising one thing and then doing another – and doing so in an underhand way. ([Location 9778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XN8UG3C&location=9778))
        - **Note**: The beauty of dempcracy is that the enemy cannot predict its next move.
