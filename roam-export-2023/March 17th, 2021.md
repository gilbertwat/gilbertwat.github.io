- [[Incidents]] of [[GOGOX]] on the deployment of [[[[GOGOX]] 3DS]] projects
    - We are deploying a migration from Stripe Charge API to Stripe PaymentIntent
    - Unfortunately there are a few problems
        - Refund logic is not code properly
            - we are unable to refund the charged amount and capture the new amount if the order is amended with increased amount.
                - Example: 60$ -> amended to 70$
                    - our logic is: 
                        - 1. refund 60$
                        - 2. capture and charge 70$
                        - 3. make transactions to driver wallet
                    - Breaks at 1.
        - We have not taken care orders in the middle of charging flow in the migration from old charge API to PaymentIntent.
            - Some payment, for example for a booking order, has been charge with old charge API but we haven't capture the amount yet
            - We are unable to capture the charge automatically
        - The rollback from new PaymentIntent the old charge API we also have not do the same consideration.

            - We are unable to capture the charge automatically.
    - Fortunately we can take care that manually thanks to our teammates.

    - Learn something from him
        - If I put in a help in 2019 [[Ka Kui Tsang]] by moving [[Anthony Chan]] to DET with him I can save him.
