- How do you feel when you wake up?
    - Made [[Wifey]] mad last night because
        - I had borrowed 50K HKD without telling her.
        - She was mad because
            - I haven't discussed with her before I have made the decision

    - Hypothesis:
        - How [[CCP]] is formulating actions 
            - They are based on 1 objective, divide and conquer
                - Example: national security law.
                    - Divide pan-dem to either try to appease to CCP or stay true to the moral
                    - Divide int'l community to either appease to CCP or  stay on course to decouple
                    - How they choose to execute is key too.
                    - With a vague and uncertain detail the objective is met.
