            - Projects
                - Customer Portal: **On track**
                    - We are integrating recommendation engine to our customer portal now.
                - Coffee App: **Delayed, catching up**
                    - We are in contact with a new contractor called James, whom Ben and I have worked with in [[GOGOX]] . We are in negotiation of scope and price.
                - Recommendation Engine: **On track**
                    - We have deployed our first version already on customer portal. Alex will share more detail next week.
                - Hubspot issue: **On track**
                    - We finalize the strategy we will be approaching the data collection of leads. TL,DR; will be we will collect everyone's lead into a single source, but everyone can still create their ways to collect data. But we will have a very clear expectation communicated what are we collecting for leads. Yoon will share more detail in the all-hands for this this week.
                - BUD application for development: **on track**
                    - We are in contact with Vincent So from Inspect Element and James. We are in parallel negotiation of scope and price.
            - Team matters
                - Good news we have some trusted potential contributors in Coffee App and possible credit system.
            - Bottleneck
                - Me to plan ahead and do all negotiation now.
