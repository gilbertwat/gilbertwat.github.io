    - **One of the telltale signs that a market is ripe for reinvention is traditional advertising.** If you see a lot of advertising in a market category, that’s a good signpost that there’s significant product atrophy. Usually, advertising signals that existing players are competing for significant revenue, but they can’t rely on product differentiation and therefore they compete on ad spend.
    - If you’re reinventing an existing market, __don’t become what you’re trying to disrupt__. For example, when Amazon was starting out, one of the biggest mistakes they could have made would’ve been going out and hiring a bunch of executives from the incumbents in the market they were trying to disrupt.
    - Founders who have success creating new industries are often people who are able to think from first principles and are outsiders with limited business experience, but with deep domain knowledge from a technical standpoint.
    - Another framework that has been used for identifying potential new markets, particularly in B2B, has been feature abstraction, i.e. turning features or products into platforms. Shopify, Twilio, Stripe, and Snowflake are all examples of B2B businesses built around products that were initially features.
