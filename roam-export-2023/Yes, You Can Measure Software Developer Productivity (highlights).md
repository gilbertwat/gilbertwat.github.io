    - To use a sufficiently nuanced system of measuring developer productivity, it’s essential to understand the three types of metrics that need to be tracked: those at the system level, the team level, and the individual level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97t09jf4zk78qj9nr8ps7k6))
    - Another critical dimension to recognize is what the various metrics do and do not tell you. For example, measuring deployment frequency or lead time for changes can give you a clear view of certain outcomes, but not of whether an engineering organization is optimized. And while metrics such as story points completed or interruptions can help determine optimization, they require more investigation to identify improvements that might be beneficial.

    - ***Inner/outer loop time spent.*** To identify specific areas for improvement, it’s helpful to think of the activities involved in software development as being arranged in two loops (Exhibit 2). An inner loop comprises activities directly related to creating the product: coding, building, and unit testing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97t50etq6wqdhkvrxfp8ezv))
    - ***Contribution analysis.*** Assessing contributions by individuals to a team’s backlog (starting with data from backlog management tools such as Jira, and normalizing data using a proprietary algorithm to account for nuances) can help surface trends that inhibit the optimization of that team’s capacity.

    - Based on industry standard capability maps, this score is a summary of the individual knowledge, skills, and abilities of a specific organization. Ideally, organizations should aspire to a “diamond” distribution of proficiency, with the majority of developers in the middle range of competency.

    - Misuse is most common when companies try to employ overly simple measurements ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h97t3nwkmbsd0qm5y9jz957n))
    - To truly benefit from measuring productivity, leaders and developers alike need to move past the outdated notion that leaders “cannot” understand the intricacies of software engineering, or that engineering is too complex to measure.

    - The mechanics of building a developer productivity initiative can seem daunting, but there is no time like the present to begin to lay the groundwork. The factors driving the need to elevate the conversation about software developer productivity to C-level leaders outweigh the impediments to doing so.

    - To help overcome these challenges and make this critical task more feasible, we developed an approach to measuring software developer productivity that is easier to deploy with surveys or existing data (such as in backlog management tools) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hba7dch0qy0xrxf6ghm75qp4))
        - **Note**: A very product management / project management approach.
    - The Developer Velocity Index (DVI) is a survey that measures an enterprise’s technology, working practices, and organizational enablement and benchmarks them against peers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hba71nafmzrt78scmnd5fanm))
