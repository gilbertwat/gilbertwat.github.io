    - Context:
        - There is an incident recently
            - Some routes cannot place order after deployment of server
                - Not online people
            - CS found out via customer feedback
            - Incident last from 1pm to 4pm  (3 hours)
                - Fixed by rolling back server
        - There is ticket status issue
            - The main ticket status is not updated properly
                - Consequence: Day 8-9 [[QA]] rush to verify
    - [QA]] capacity challenge
        - Symptoms
            - do not help in creating solution in firefighting situation
            - missing communication on the ticket
            - missing information on the ticket from CS 
            - product driven vs ticket by ticket
        - Probable root cause
            - [QA]] is overwhelmed
    - [[Actionables]]:
        - DONE: Agree with [[Shamiya Patel]] concrete process to follow
        - Use more online communication for firefighting situation
        - Schedule agreements with the team to push quality and maintain reliability
        - Work with [[Keith Chan]] on growing [[Karl Tai]] to be more responsible
            - Suggestion: be warm and kind to contrast [[Keith Chan]] üòÖ
