- How to deal with the current [[[[Preface]] Coding]] contract
    - [[decided]] to delay a bit on the contract signing as ESOP is not ready yet. Pushed a bit on [[Vegas Ho]] side
        - I don't want to get "scammed" again.
        - I don't want to give an impression of signing up on something not concrete.
- 09:00 - 12:00 [[[[Preface]] Coffee & Wine]] grand opening
    - [[[[Preface]] Coding]] culture
        - A very very strong branding
        - The engineering team is very exciting to see me join.
        - A very open culture
            - Improvement: I need to ask hard questions without holding up.

            - A lot of request on talents joining
                - QA
                - Senior engineers and data analyst
                - need to get creative and maintain an open culture.
            - Very messy product prioritization
            - Some personal feud on working style from Scrum master with the team
                - Slow to catch up the collaborative speed of the team
                - {{[[DONE]]}} Is that true that Scrum master is not adding value to the team iteration speed?
                    - Underwork? Fear of losing job?
            - No organizational structure
            - [[Hunch]] [[To be validated]] Need a lot of warmth and human touch to get things done
