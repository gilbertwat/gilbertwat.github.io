            - We cannot aligned an effective communication channel and cadence with him/her.
            - We cannot foresee a future that he/she can be contributing to our projects.

            - We are assigning a scope of work to the person and still need to micromanage the execution of the scope of work.

                - Recognise and reiterate the need for further data collection to proceed with more impactful machine learning
                - [[Tommie Lo]] propose looking into an approach that focuses on a more specific subset of data needed for a focused ML experiment instead of canvasing a wide range of data
                    - Difficult to capture all the perceived necessary data in one go
                - Discussion about [[Tommie Lo]]'s vision for machine learning content recommendation
                    - Have a model that can recommend content close to the student's interests
he recommendation is for a singular 'entity' but that entity can be made up of `N` number of students
                        - In case of multiple students, we can aggregate some calculation of interests
            - Moving Forward

            - Discussion
                - Content Team Workflow & Challenges
                    - No meaningful feedback loop to know if curriculum topics are close to the interests of students
                    - Actual note generation is not the biggest issue. Generally as long as the content team knows what topic to use, the rest follows
            - General
                - Presented purpose of the meeting
                    - Connect with  content team and see how the data team may be able to facilitate or enhance the workflow
                    - Potential leveraging of existing webscraping project to enhance content identification and/or generation
                    - Topic generation seems to be the most direct entry point
                        - Current webscraping list is very SEO focused
                        - If using the [[SEO Project]] to generate topics for curriculum building, will need to have a more comprehensive list of websites that can be focused o targeted at specific audiences
                        - Brief discussion about targeting people who visit the Preface blog but do not convert into customers
                        - Will require profiling of those users

                                - initiative to create weekly casual learning sessions on the most uptrend or hot topics
