        - Meeting Notes
            - Sharing the gap in quality of work expected from us and him
                - __**It is a sharing document, will iterate. Focus on UX**__
                    - Shared that UX there is also gaps.
                    - Not expecting the first version to be in such stage.
                - **__Time is a big constraint.__**
                    - Shared that time is not a constraint now, quality is.
                    - Updated the collaboration model to be:
                        - Ask about what will be needed for him to do his best job.
                        - Proposed the ideal solution from him
                        - Trim by teammates with rationales.
            - Culture problem I picked up
                - **__No one is hearing my concerns before.__**
                    - From now on Gilbert, Ben and Anna will be helping you to resolve those blockers.
                - **__I don't have enough tools to design my best work.__**
                    - A change of mindset needs to happen, rather than constraining himself, challenge himself to find the right person to talk to.
                        - Example: 
                            - If the design system missed some elements, he needs to contribute. (Serif font, monospace font, missing brand color that is warm)
            - Expectation set
                - Best his best self for 8 hours per week day, resolving UI/UX design issues with product / engineering team
                - Bring up challenges in doing his best job (Design System, illustrations, assets, photography, time ...etc.) and proactively resolve those, Gilbert and other leaders are here to help.
                - Can use very technical design lingo to discuss design issues with design team and tech team.
                    - Example set:
                        - In the meeting we discuss about the color of the primary button and CTA button
                            - In the original design, we use the darkest gray and brand blue for two type of colors.
                            - Gilbert found the color of the secondary button is too strong.
                            - In the debate, we explored:
                                - In the design system, we need to emphasize the button.
                                - In other luxurious brand, we have no exception to use darkest gray to be the color of the primary button.
                                - Data tell brand blue is having the highest number of clicks in our public website.
                                - By hierarchy, they are of the same level.
                            - We settled with a better colors for the secondary button with the rationale of hierarchy
