    - Why I am reading [[ethereum]] yellow paper?
        - Because I finally has the emotion energy to do so.
    - Random notes
        - $$\mathbb{N}$$ = non-negative integers
        - $$\mathbb{B}$$ = byte sequence
        - $$Ïƒ$$ = world-state
        - $$Î¼$$ = machine-state
        - $$Î¥$$ = Ethereum state transition function
        - $$Î $$ = block-level state-transition function
        - $$B$$ = block
        - $$Î©$$ = block-finalization state transition function (rewarding functions)
        - $$C$$ = cost functions
        - $$T$$ = transaction
        - A group of transitions = blocks
        - blocks are chained using a cryptographic hash
        - generate consensus is asimplified version of the [[GHOST protocol]]
        - [[Merkle Patricia tree]] AKA [[Trie]] is keeping the world-state
            - world-state is a mapping between addresses and account states
                - account states is serialized as RLP  
                    - = $$Ïƒ[a]$$

                    - An account is empty when it has no code, zero nonce
