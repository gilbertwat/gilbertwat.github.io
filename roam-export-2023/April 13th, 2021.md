    - a direct [[Giving candid and actionable feedback]] [[feedback]] technique just now for 1 on 1:
        - So Peter is too rush in the 3DS project, resulting the current “delay” of the project. Gave a direct feedback and seems receptive.
            - 1. Ask him what does he think about the projects, he seems to be stressful about it and feel there is something wrong.
            - 2. Agree and let him rant a bit.
            - 3. State my observation.
            - 4. Get his agreement.
            - 5. And ask if he already think of any improvement can be done next time.
            - 6. Agree again.
            - 7. And add some parts what do I think where is wrong and how to improve.
            - 8. Seems receptive.
    - Also this is based on the high trust I already have with Peter. It just make the matter better.
