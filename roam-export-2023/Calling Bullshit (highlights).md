    - An important genre of bullshit known as weasel wording uses the gap between literal meaning and implicature to avoid taking responsibility for things. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=478))
    - Additional stories and tidbits are scrolling across our social media feeds faster than we could track, even if we did nothing else. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=663))
    - The study found that the most successful headlines don’t convey facts, they promise you an emotional experience. The most common phrase among successful Facebook headlines, by nearly twofold, is “will make you,” as in “will break your heart,” “will make you fall in love,” “will make you look twice,” or “will make you gasp in surprise” as above. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=696))
    - On the Web, we are all test subjects. Commercial websites are continually running large-scale experiments to see what keeps us online and engaged. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=759))
    - Social media facilitates the spread of misinformation—claims that are false but not deliberately designed to deceive. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=777))
    - While we think of propaganda as designed to convince people of specific untruths, much modern propaganda has a different aim. The “firehose strategy” is designed to leave the audience disoriented and despairing of ever being able to separate truth from falsehood. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=820))
    - “The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.” ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=824))
    - Still, fake news is not primarily a propaganda tool. Most fake and hyperpartisan news is created for a different reason: to generate advertising revenue. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=828))
    - Conducted on a sufficiently large scale, counterfeiting can undermine public trust in a currency, devalue the currency, and drive runaway inflation. Counterfeiting has often been used this way during wartime—by the British in the American Revolutionary War, by the Union in the American Civil War, and by the Nazis in the Second World War, to list just a few examples. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=844))
    - In an Internet-connected world, governments have to worry about a new kind of counterfeiting—not of money, but of people. Researchers estimate that about half of the traffic on the Internet is due not to humans, but rather “bots,” ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=847))
    - In a word, we triangulate. We no longer trust a single message, a single image, a single claim. We look for independent witnesses who can confirm testimony. We seek multiple images from multiple vantage points. Society will adjust similarly to a world of deepfakes and whatever reality-bending technologies follow. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=891))
    - Harry Frankfurt, the philosopher we introduced in the preface, refined this notion a bit further. He described bullshit as what people create when they try to impress you or persuade you, without any concern for whether what they are saying is true or false, correct or incorrect. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=932))
    - Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade or impress an audience by distracting, overwhelming, or intimidating them with a blatant disregard for truth, logical coherence, or what information is actually being conveyed. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=949))
    - In our view, a lie becomes bullshit when the speaker attempts to conceal it using various rhetorical artifices. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=985))
    - Most often, bullshit arises either because there are biases in the data that get fed into the black box, or because there are obvious problems with the results that come out. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=999))
    - Being able to spot bullshit based on data is a critical skill. Decades ago, fancy language and superfluous detail might have served a bullshitter’s needs. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1011))
    - In particular, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1078))
    - “If she were a Canadian, she would be more likely to be bilingual.” The former statement simply suggests an association. The latter statement suggests that being Canadian causes bilinguality. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1293))
    - It’s human to make these mistakes. We are excellent at seeing patterns, and this ability can help us generalize from one experience to another. ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1343))
    - One of the easiest ways to get a spurious correlation in trends over time is to look at very simple trends. There are millions of different things we could go out and measure. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1378))
    - There is a key distinction between a probabilistic cause (A increases the chance of B in a causal manner), a sufficient cause (if A happens, B always happens), and a necessary cause (unless A happens, B can’t happen). ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1397))
    - Taking a mean of the tax cuts, they report that their tax plan will save families an average $4,000 per year. Maybe so, but the average family—if by that we mean one in the middle of the income range—will save nothing. The majority of us would be better off knowing the tax cut for a family with the median income. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1491))
    - “25% Less Fat* Than the Average of the Leading Chocolate Candy Brands.” The asterisk directs us to small print reading “5 grams of fat per 30 gram serving compared to 7 grams of fat in the average of the leading chocolate candy brands.” ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1549))
    - Thus, a Starbucks drip coffee is about 0.075 percent caffeine by weight. In other words, strong coffee is also 99.9 percent caffeine free! ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1568))
    - This is a decrease of $6,602 per unit. But what was the percentage change? Should we say it was 34 percent (because $6,602 is 34.3 percent of $19,221), or is it 52 percent (because $6,602 is 52.4 percent of $12,609)? ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1606))
    - Percentages get even more slippery when we are comparing one percentage figure to another. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1642))
    - a 1 percentage point decrease in incidence corresponds to a 50 percent decrease. ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1662))
    - This is an example of a more general issue with comparisons that involve fractions or percentages: Changing denominators obscure changes in numerators. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1672))
    - Percentage calculations can give strange answers when any of the numbers involved are negative. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1695))
    - When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1728))
    - If no one knew that you were going to evaluate schools by looking at test scores of students, test scores might provide a reasonable way of measuring schools’ effectiveness. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1747))
    - We see mathiness as classic bullshit in the vein of our original definition. ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1772))
        - **Note**: Why it is hard to define an equation maybe because it is bs and not able to withstand logical reduction
    - You make a false promise when you suggest that happiness is an arithmetic sum of three things, if all you mean is that it increases with each of them. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=1835))
    - Five years ago, engineers at Google applied machine learning techniques to their own hiring process, in an effort to identify the most productive employees. They found a surprising result: Job performance was negatively correlated with prior success in programming contests. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2119))
    - The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. ([Location 2177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2177))
    - So what’s going on? The data are misleading because they are right-censored—individuals who are still alive at the end of the study period are removed from the study. ([Location 2197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2197))
        - **Note**: LTV calculation maybe suffering from this.
    - We have described bullshit as being intended to persuade or impress by distracting, overwhelming, or intimidating an audience with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence. ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2382))
    - Periodic tables and subway maps are highly specific forms of visualization. ([Location 2441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2441))
    - Venn diagrams, the overlapping ovals used to represent group membership for items that may belong to multiple groups, ([Location 2442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2442))
    - By changing the bin widths, Schultz was able to craft stories about how we need to tax the poor, the middle class (now defined as making less than $100,000 taxable income), and the very rich. ([Location 2581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2581))
    - The problem with this figure is that it uses shaded regions to represent numerical values, but the areas of these regions are not proportional to the values they represent. It violates what we term the principle of proportional ink: ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2607))
    - Government policies can demand accountability, but they’re not worth much if no one can understand what is going on well enough to explain what the algorithm is doing.fn11 ([Location 2997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=2997))
    - Philosophers often describe knowledge as “justified true belief.” To know something, it has to be true and we have to believe it—but we also have to be able to provide a justification for our belief. ([Location 3008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3008))
    - they seek it not either for pleasure of the mind, or for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit, or fame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the benefit and use of life; and that they perfect and govern it in charity. ([Location 3096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3096))
    - Their results should be novel, relevant, complete, and correct. ([Location 3107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3107))
    - You and the prosecutor have each stressed different conditional probabilities. A conditional probability is the chance that something is true, given other information. The prosecutor asks what the chance is that there is a false match, given an innocent person chosen at random.fn4 We can write this as P(match|innocent). You are asking the converse: What is the chance that your client is innocent, given that there is a match, which we write as P(innocent|match). People often assume that these two probabilities must be the same, but that is not true. In our example, P(match|innocent) = 1/10,000,000 whereas P(innocent|match) = 5/6. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3229))
    - So here’s the dirty secret about p-values in science. When scientists report p-values, they’re doing something a bit like the prosecutor did in reporting the chance of an innocent person matching the fingerprint from the crime scene. ([Location 3258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3258))
    - Rather, it represents yet one additional contribution to an oft-studied question, marginally shifting our beliefs in the direction of the hypothesis “red wine has cardiac benefits.” ([Location 3489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3489))
    - Practicing scientists understand this. Researchers don’t make up their minds about a complex question based on an individual research report, but rather, weigh the evidence across multiple studies and strive to understand why multiple studies often produce seemingly inconsistent results. ([Location 3492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=3492))
    - A null model helps us understand what we would observe in a very simple system where not much is going on. In this case we can use a computer simulation to create a pretend world where age doesn’t affect running speed. ([Location 4225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4225))
    - Find ways to decouple issues of identity from the matter you are trying to debunk. ([Location 4245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4245))
    - Keep it simple. One advantage that falsehood has over truth is that the truth is often complicated whereas falsehoods can be crafted to be simple. ([Location 4249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4249))
    - Take it offline. Take your conversations offline if you can. No one likes to be called out in public. ([Location 4252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4252))
    - Find common ground. The less antagonistic your interaction is, the more likely someone will seriously consider your ideas. ([Location 4256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4256))
    - Don’t overemphasize the myth. ([Location 4261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4261))
    - Fill in knowledge gaps with alternative explanations. It is not enough to simply debunk a myth; you need to replace it with an alternative account. ([Location 4263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4263))
    - Judiciousness. A caller of bullshit makes a careful decision about whether it is worthwhile to speak up, derail a conversation, risk a confrontation, or make someone feel defensive. ([Location 4338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0848RGH4Z&location=4338))
