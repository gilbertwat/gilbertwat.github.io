        - Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourage careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions. Instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer's standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products.
        - Good engineering is characterized by a gradual, step-wise refinement of products that yields increased performance under given constraints and with given resources.
        - Analytical verification and correctness-proof techniques fare even worse; In addition, these methods require a higher intellectual calibar than that required by the customary "try and fix it" approach.
        - 3 principles
            - Concentrated on the essentials
            - OOP, type-safe (FP now)
            - flexibly extendible
        - A clear conceptual basis and a well-conceived, appropriate system structure is the price.
        - Learning
            - A strongly typed language was the most influential factor in designing this complex system in such a short time. (probably not always)
            - Most difficult design task is to find the most appropriate decomposition of the whole into a module hierarchy, minimizing function and code duplications. (Refactoring + TDD can solve it)
            - identify primitives that offer the most flexibility for extensions
            - To gain experience, there is no substitute for one's own programming effort, All should participate in all aspects of developer (mangers, designers, programmers, analysts and users)
            - Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality. Runs doesn't cuts.
