    - Think about my [[logseq]] workflow with here
        - Originally type in [[logseq]] and import here, I am going to swap and treat [[logseq]] as an output instead.
            - Reasons:
                - Sync in [[logseq]] is troublesome
                - My workflow in here is more fluid and efficient.
