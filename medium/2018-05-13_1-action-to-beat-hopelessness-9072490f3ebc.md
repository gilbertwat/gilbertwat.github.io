### 1 action to beat hopelessness

In our generation, we had a lot of seemingly unsolvable problems. The city is
dying, the country is dying, hell even the world is dying. The newspaper is
broadcasting news that is depressing. The government is doing nothing to
rectify the imbalance of prosperity. The state is moving to destabilize the
world to keep their power. Everything is breaking our generation will to
change.

But there is one thing I am clinging on — the will and power to make 1 thing
better each day. Make your family members feel good. Praise a co-worker. Say
thank you to the cleaner on the street. Give way to an elderly. Say hi to a
friend you almost lose touch of. To bring joy into your life. And you know you
can still do a lot. And slowly you know you can, and if enough of us feel
that, let’s make something great.
