My guess is this have to do with the market reality of Greater China market.
In China, anything that showing a laowai(non Chinese especially white)
speaking in Mandarin Chinese, makes the consumers feel respected and proud. It
has nothing to do on race or color issues here in the States. I am not saying
it is right but a practical tactic for Apple. Search videos for 金坷拉 to see the
extreme of this kind of marketing move. It is hilarious!
