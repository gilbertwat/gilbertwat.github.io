# Function / Usability / Scalability / Test?

<!-- 		@page { margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } -->
<p lang="en-US">In my recent development of my own application in Android, I have faced a dilemma: all I have got is 8 hours a day maximum for programming. I can do any 1 of 4 things in the next iteration. My iteration is due this weekend. Here is the list of my “wish-list”,</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Add a fancy new 	function in the search function. The algorithm is completed and what 	missing is just implementation.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Refactor my code to 	use the ContentProvider and ContentResolver to make my application 	more scalable and extend easily. I can in the meantime do some 	housework in my code and implement a RESTful style of code.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Add a completely new 	UI feature to utilize Gesture in Android. I can also rearrange the 	UI to be more usable, more commercial and easier to use.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Add a test project 	and implement testing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US">All three of them is posing a bit of challenge to me. In my estimation, the third one will be the hardest, but just a bit. Here is another list of Pros and Cons.</p>
<p lang="en-US">Pros.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">So.. it is fancy and 		make my application tons more useful.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">The module I can 		port it to other application and platform if my method of doing it 		is good enough.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I can expand my 		application easier in the future.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">A real taste of 		RESTful development, which I was introduced in the University but 		never truly taste it.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I can better 		maintain my code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">The application will 		be natural to use. Unlike now, the buttons are awkward and 		primitive.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I can learn gesture 		in Android.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">The module again can 		be port into other Android App.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I can apply test 		method in real situation, not just the dummy example in University 		course.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I can better test my 		code and make it more robust.(less compliant! Yah!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US">Cons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Actually it is 		simple.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">It is not an eye 		candy. Everyone is getting used to it(Damn you Google!).</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">My code will still 		be a mess.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">The users will see 		nothing. Experience told me what the user can't see usually doesn't 		worth my effort, even the user is a computer science professional.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I am out of internet 		in the moment. It is impossible for me to “learn by example”.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">The algorithm is 		untested. It may not be working at I think.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">My code will be even 		messier.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">Again, the users 		will see nothing.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p lang="en-US">I only have a tiny 		bit of memory in software testing. I am a good student that never 		remember what is taught after the exam.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US"> </p>
<p lang="en-US">Yes I can do that one by one, as it is a personal project and the deadline is set by myself. And I am a self-forgiving person, so this is unimportant in the real situation. But what I want to know is, “what will people choose if there are constraints, namely TIME and MONEY?” What if I am under a great deal of pressure that I must complete this weekend?</p>
<p lang="en-US">So what do you think? Which one I should choose?</p>
