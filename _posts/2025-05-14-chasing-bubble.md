My beloved Theodore,

This afternoon had to be one of my happiest moments. It had nothing to do with the App I built that reached a thousand subscribers. It also had nothing to do with the praise I received from colleagues for a well-put presentation. It had nothing to do with my promotion in my career.

This sunny afternoon I played soap bubble with you and your mother.

“I want to go to the grass.”, you kept asking us as we were approaching the grassland in the West Kowloon area. Once there, we barely unpacked ourselves and pulled out your favorite - a bottle of soap. You tried to create bubbles again. But your 3-year-old hands were not as dextile as you want. Quickly you switched to chase the bubble. You chased them and ran across the grass. Your mother and I got creative. To create as many bubbles for you to chase as possible, we crouched, we posted a horse stance. We jogged in the tailwind or headwind, holding up the bubble wand. We drew rainbows with the bubble wand.

Your sweaty head, smile and laughter were imprinted in my brain. On a mostly empty grassland, under warm sunlight, it is perfect.

As your little legs grew tired, I didn't want this moment to pass. I became your legs. I picked you up and chased for some more minutes before I too was exhausted.

Your pure joy at the moment fulfilled me even as I am writing this.

Thank you son for the moment. With love,

Baba
