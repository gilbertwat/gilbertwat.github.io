title: 1 action to beat hopelessness
---

In our generation, we have a lot of seemingly unsolvable problems. The city is dying, the country is dying, hell even the world is dying. The mainstream media is broadcasting depressing new. The government is doing nothing to rectify the imbalance of prosperity. The state is moving to destabilize the world to keep their power. Everything is breaking our generation will to change.

But there is one thing I am clinging on — the will and power to make 1 thing better each day. Make your family members feel good. Praise a co-worker. Say thank you to the cleaner on the street. Give way to an elderly. Say hi to a friend you almost lose touch of. Bring joy into your life. And you know you can still do a lot. And slowly you know you can, and if enough of us feel that, let’s make something great.
