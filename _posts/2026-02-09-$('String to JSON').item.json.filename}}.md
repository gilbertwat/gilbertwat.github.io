It sounds sophisticated. It sounds elite. But it’s a dangerous direction.

Taste is often just code for "I am the boss, you should just follow." Judgment is being used to gatekeep roles from a younger generation. And Speed? We’re already losing that race to silicon.

McKinsey predicts 40% of white-collar work will be replaced in 2030. Current data shows entry-level roles in the US have already plummeted by 50%.

If we only value "Elite Taste," we aren't building a future—we’re building a prison of pride. We’re protecting a status quo that leaves no room for the next generation.

When the future looks grim on the news, the courageous and the humble are doing something else entirely.

Courage is the one dare to say, "I will build something new." AI follows patterns; It cannot take the risks that move humanity forward.

Humility is the secret weapon that breaks out of the prison. The humbles are busy remodeling their world views. They have the clarity of who they are beyond a corporate bracket.

The future doesn't belong to those with the "best" taste. It belongs to those with the courage to take risks and the humility to serve a purpose larger than their own.

The stats are a warning, not a destiny. The corporate ladder is changing, but the human spirit is un-automatable.
