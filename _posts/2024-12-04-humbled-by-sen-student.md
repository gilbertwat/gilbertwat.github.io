title: The day I was humbled by a SEN student
---

Last Wednesday, a group of students with special educational needs (SEN) visited our campus. They brought us their noise, excitement and fickleness. During their visit, I was sitting next to a stop of their tour, trying hard to glue my attention on my laptop to get some work done. As the tour eventually arrived and stopped next to me, one of the students approached my desk briefly. He caught my attention. Then he said, "Thank you for taking care of us today." I was struck out of my flow. I mechanically acknowledged his gratitude. After a brief contemplation, I decided to look for his teacher in the crowd. I told his teacher what a wonderful student he was. As they were leaving for another stop, I cannot stop myself from having the feeling of humbled by this particular SEN student.
