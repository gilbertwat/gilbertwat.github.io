## Introduction
I feel exceedingly pressured as I am choosing a kindergarten for my son. This is one of the first few major decisions for my son. It will have a great impact in my son’s life in the next 3 years. I hope to consider and weight options as thorough as I could, combine with my intuition and the love of God, my wife and I, my son can access the best education for him available.

But first, why should I bother?

As I contemplate this important decision, I must first understand my "Why" before delving into my "How" of choosing a kindergarten. The answer of this question will be my guidance. I can use the answer to remain focus on the important criteria whilst unbounded by personal biases and societal expectations. I must therefore ask, "Why does my son has to go a kindergarten?"

Upon reflection, the answer emerges clearly. My son absolutely needs a kindergarten to be independent, to forge new friendships, and to practice the essential social skills. Contemporary child psychology researches suggest that the ages of 3-6 are critical for developing these fundamental abilities. If he were to miss this opportunity, he might face challenges in these areas later in life, potentially limiting his life experiences. Putting him into a kindergarten is the best, if not the only way in Hong Kong for my family to provide an environment for my son to be independent, meet new friends and play with them.

## The path forward: How will I choose?

Having established the "why”, I find myself naturally progressing to the next crucial question: "What kind of kindergarten should I choose for my son?" Latest child development theory suggests that in the age of 3-6, my son will need nurturing in these five key areas:

* Language Development: Helping my boy talk better, use more words, and chat with his friends and teachers in a fun way.
* Cognitive Skills: Getting my son to think on his feet, remember stuff, and focus better through play and exploring the world around him.
* Social-Emotional Skills: Teaching my little guy to understand his feelings, care about others, and handle tough situations when playing with friends.
* Fine Motor Skills: Improving how my son uses his hands for things like drawing, playing with toys, and learning to take care of himself.
* Gross Motor Skills: Encouraging my boy to run, jump, and balance better through lots of outdoor play and fun activities.

While these areas of development are crucial, I find myself pondering if there's something more fundamental missing from this framework. Without a greater purpose or "goal," my son might develop all the necessary skills but lack a direction of life. It's akin to building a magnificent vehicle without a destination in mind. This realization prompts me to consider the broader goals he might pursue throughout his life, and how the foundation laid in kindergarten might shape his ability to set and achieve those goals.

In light of this, my ideal kindergarten has to align with my value system and my view of education. Fail to have that alignment, I am afraid that my son will have a very hard life to adapt into two misaligned sets of value systems. For instance, the school put unparalleled emphasis to his academic excellence, but I am not a parent that celebrate academic excellence particularly. My boy will have a hard time to succeed in school without the full hearted help from his father. Even if he does succeed, my reaction will be unauthentic and lackluster at best. He won’t found the true sense of fulfillment without the genuine praise from his father.

Then I explore more about my value system and view of education. So far my one-liner for this question is:

**Education is about fostering my son’s strength, courage and resilience to explore the world and love others as he loves himself.**

For example, I would expect the kindergarten to help us foster my son affinity of music and storytelling. Also the kindergarten will have the resources to expose him to related opportunities, and connect him with kids whom are enjoying similar interests. I will be put off for kindergarten to look at the strength of my son and turn it into a weakness, putting light hearted attitude and out-of-the-box creativity as rebellious and talkative. Another take is that of course expecting kindergarten to fully realizing his potential is not realistic, so I will put more emphasis on an atmosphere of caring and encouraging exploration the kindergarten creates.

With these considerations in mind, I've distilled my criteria for choosing a kindergarten for my son into 4 key points:

1. Partner with us on fostering my son’s strength, courage and resilience to explore the world and love others as he loves himself.
2. Keep us heavily involved and informed in my son’s development through latest technology and effective practices
3. Nurture my son's fundamentals in the five basic categories of development through play-based learning
4. Broaden my son’s exposure to diversity of perspectives and cultures

## The practical factors

After these high level thinking, I am settled and I must come back from the cloud and put my feet on the ground. Overlooking the tangible, practical factors will significantly affect my son’s daily experience. These mundane details can profoundly shape my son's educational journey and overall well-being. After careful consideration, I've identified four key practical factors that warrant our attention:

1. Teachers: I want great teachers who stick around. The good ones really make a difference in creating a warm, stable place for my kid. Teachers who've been there a while usually know their stuff and get what the school's all about.
2. School Building and Playgrounds: The place where my son spends his day matters a lot. A well-thought-out, safe, and fun environment can really spark his curiosity and help him learn in different ways.
3. After-School Stuff: I'm keen on what the school offers beyond regular classes. It'd be great if my boy could try out different things, pick up new skills, and feel good about himself in the process.
4. Getting To and From School: This might seem small, but it's actually pretty important. How we get to school can make or break our day. If we've got safe and reliable ways to get there, it'll help my son start and end his school day on the right foot.

While our primary criteria remain paramount, I must also consider some secondary practical factors such as class sizes, curriculum, schedules and technology. These elements contribute to the overall kindergarten experience and warrant attention in our evaluation process. While they won't overshadow our main criteria, they will certainly inform our final decision.

## So In conclusion…

So to give my son the best education possibly, my criteria of kindergarten goes from a vague, biased and chaotic thoughts to a list of focal points from the ideals to the practicals.

1. Good Teachers and Nice School: I want to make sure my little guy's in a safe place that'll help him grow and learn.
2. Teaming Up with the School: I'm looking for a place that'll work with us to help my son become strong, brave, and able to bounce back from tough stuff.
3. Staying in the Loop: I want to know what's going on with my kid at school, so having good ways to chat with teachers is a big deal for me.
4. Learning Through Play: I'm all for my son learning important stuff while having fun and playing around.
5. Meeting Different People: I think it'd be great for my boy to learn about different ways of living and thinking from an early age.
6. Fun After-School Activities and Easy School Trips: I want my son to have cool things to do after class and not stress about getting to and from school. It'll help him be ready to learn and enjoy his day.

As I conclude this reflection, I am relieved and ready. I am clear on my decision-making process on picking a kindergarten. I am also curious about others' perspectives. What criteria guide your choice of kindergarten for your kids? How do you balance the practical aspects of education with their character development and life purpose?
