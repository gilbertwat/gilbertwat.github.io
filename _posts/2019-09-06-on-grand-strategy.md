title: Insights from book: On Grand Strategy
---

The current event in Hong Kong gives us a practice ground of any level of group coordination. The tactics of protestors to protect themselves from police brutality. The strategy, or lack thereof on the police side to use violence to curb the peaceful protest. The level of struggle between Hong Kongers and Chinese government is touching the part of grand strategy of multiple parties. As a history and software geek I am always fascinated by the complexity of grand strategy and the apparent randomness of events. That's why I am reading this classics of grand strategy to understand more about grand strategy and how it helps an organization survives and thrives.

This book portraits a way to glimpse some of the stories from different prominent historic figures. Lincoln, Issac Berlin just to quote a few. Here are some exceprt I found very insightful.

> Common sense, in this sense, is like oxygen: The higher you go, the thinner it gets.

Simply LMAO. And a reminder to keep your attention down to earth.

> You learn to play the game by having a coach, literally a "trainer," who does what drill instructors used to do when military service was mandatory: teach the basics, build stamina, enforce discipline, encourage collaboration, show you how to fail and to recover from failure. Once the game begins, though, your coach can only shout or sulk from the sidelines.

As a newly promoted manager, I am very confused about my role in the team. This gives me a direction on how to position myself.

> ...the foundations of England's post-Stuart political culture: Suspicion of Utopias and zealots; trust in common sense and experience; respect for tradition; preference for gradual change; and the view that "compromise" is victory, not betrayal. These things stem from the failure of both royal absolutism and of godly republicanism: costly failures, and fruitful ones.

Hong Kong is inheriting this and to a lesser extent me too.

> ...an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will

Love it, and when it doesn't do the job, you are using it wrong.

> My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.

That's show the priority of Abe Lincoln is very succinct. And everything he does is to achieve the objective of saving the Union.

> Which allows such leaders then to convey, to those citizens, "a sense of understanding their inner needs, of responding to their own deepest impulses, above all of being alone capable of organizing the worl along lines for whcih they are instinctively groping.

Suddenly understand as a manager, I am here to motivate and make things happen.
