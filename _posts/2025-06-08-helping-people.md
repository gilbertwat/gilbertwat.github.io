## 2 humbling little encounters in an afternoon

Under the heated sun, with a suffocating atmosphere in early June, I went to grab myself a cup of coffee with my colleagues after our lunch. As I was waiting for my relief from the heat under the air-conditioning, I saw an old woman and a young man, standing under the heat of the sun at noon, sweating with 2 suitcases on the street. The young man altered his attention between his phone and the surroundings, to find out where they were and which direction to go.

Upon recognizing the need of the duo, I asked my colleagues to help collect my cup if it was ready. Then I departed from the air-conditioned coffee shop to approach them. And I asked, “Where are you going? Do you need help?” Both ignored me at first and then looked at me in contempt. The young man frowned at me and answered, “No.” After a second of shock, I threw up my hands and went back to the air-conditioned coffee shop. I continued my wait.

After I fetched my iced coffee, my colleagues and I walked straight back to the office. And I saw the duo again at another crossroad. I refused to let go and asked again, “Do you need help?” Both rejected me in the same fashion. And one of my colleagues commented, “There is someone who doesn’t want to be helped.”

I don’t understand why. I can only pray for them.

Later that day, I passed by a hospital alone. At the entrance of the hospital, I saw a girl sitting in her stroller, sobbing. Her mother stood next to her, scolded, “Why are you dropping your toys again? Show me your hand\!” The girl put up hand, and her mother started beating her little hand. The girl cried louder. Her mother kept scolding her. The girl cried even louder.

The situation was a mess.

Innately, I would like to help. There were tens of ideas floating in my brain, but none of the solutions right at that moment is appropriate. I feel helpless in my limited wisdom and intellect.

I am choked. I can only pray for them.
