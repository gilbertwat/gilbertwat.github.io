title: My Instagram got hacked, now what?
---

This morning when I woke up and did my daily routine of checking Email, two very suspicious Emails showed up in my inbox.

Of course first thing first I check if it is a scam or not. It seems not be the case:

- Email is legit
- Reset password link SSL cert is legit

I immediately check if the hackers has posted something on my behalf. After all, all I care is my reputation. Luckily there is none. What a relief. :relieved:

Of course the next move I take is to reset my password. Twice. I admit it is irrational but it makes me feel cleaner. This password cracker really give me a sense of violated.

After this irrational move have tended my own emotion my rational self came back. I was very concerned about the __blast radius__. How many of my personal information is here and can be considered compromised? How many accounts are linked to this Instagram account and I need to take care of? Can people use those information to do harm? I went through a thorough exercise, and I concluded my personal photos, phone numbers, 2 Email addresses and Facebook accounts has a higher risks of compromising. Luckily I have published those information somewhere and there is nothing I am too concerned about.

It is very lucky that I always practice a good security hygience to prevent an all out leakage of my personal information. My principles are simple:

1. Use a password manager. My recommendation is [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [iCloud KeyChain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085). Before I subscribed to password manager, I reuse password. That doesn't give me the peace of mind. So I added a trick of tiered different services into 3 tiers. I reused password for the same tier and I won't put sensitive information into services in lower tier.
2. Everything I uploaded to facebook is considered public. This company cannot be trusted.
3. Use a long password. For example, `%4FHcdh` is less secured than `this-is-a-good-pwd` or `hack-shanghai-xijingping-winnie`. Just checkout your password strength in [this tool](https://www.my1login.com/resources/password-strength-test/)

Hope you won't have to go through what I had this morning!
