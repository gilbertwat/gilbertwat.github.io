Hong Kong is still so lovely where you can find this wild hog trap only 5
minutes away from the residential area in Hong Kong Island. This wild hog is
placed beside a cemetery. Unlike other cities I have been, when people must
drive a few hours away from the metropolitan area to see the nature. here
nature is just a few minutes walk away.
