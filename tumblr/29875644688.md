> Town hall of Kolašin, Montenegro. It’s a former Yugoslavian Spomenik
> (monument) built during Tito’s regime of the 60s and 70s in the former
> Yugoslavia. Photo by Jan Kempenaers.
>
> Presumably designed by either Bogdan Bogdanović or Gradimir Medaković, it
> stands out from the other Slavic Monuments as actually being the town hall
> and community centre of Kolašin, a small town in northern Montenegro.
>
> Resonating with the avant-garde architecture being built in the Soviet Union
> at the time, the utopia being offered by these architects examplifies what
> Owen Hatherley has described as ‘nostagia for a time yet to come’.
