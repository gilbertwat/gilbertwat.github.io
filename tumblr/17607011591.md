Let's start with something small. One day I was passing through one of the
busiest streets in Hong Kong, I saw a bunch of people, surrounding something.
The street wisdom is to never join the crowd. It turns out there was a
foreigner, twisting balloon to make dolls. Everyone's happy. That's what our
city needs, some happy guys can always spread happiness.
