Here is our result of 3 guys and gals after 4 hours of cleaning on one of the
beach in Mei Wo(梅窩).

Recently Hong Kong was hit by a tychoon directly. 6 cargos full of plastic
pallet fell to the ocean and all the pallets is now affecting Hong Kong. Many
of our citizens organized ourselves up and went to the beach to clean up. The
pallets are very small, indistinguishable for filters and there are so many of
them. But there are so many of us, this makes me felt hope. Turned out to
clean the whole damn beach full of plastic waste. Even a few condoms can be
found…

Please, dispose those stuff in proper place after having a great time.
