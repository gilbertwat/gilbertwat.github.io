# Why does this blog exist?

After my travel to Europe, I am aware that most of the people in the world
have many different misconceptions about Chinese. Even the word "Chinese" is a
misconception. I am writing to introduce my points of view, as a Chinese
living in Hong Kong while I am traveling around China. The trip will not be
continuous, as I got obligations of my family, but I will start with my
hometown, Hong Kong. I will start traveling around Hong Kong, starting with
some of the famous site for foreigners, and then introduce some of the "less-
traveled" parts of Hong Kong, especially where you can get quality local
foods. I will also cover some festival and events around Hong Kong, as long as
they fit into my schedule.
