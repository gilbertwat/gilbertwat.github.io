Instead of the obvious old man salvaging in the rubbish bin, notice the
unusual amount of cigarettes burning on the rubbish bin. In Hong Kong, we have
a [Tobacco Control Office](http://www.tco.gov.hk/eindex.html) who will give
you a fine of $1500HKD(~200USD) because you are smoking in restricted area.
Restricted area includes every parks in Hong Kong. A guy was found smoking in
some obscure restricted area and some other not so obvious place like bus
stops. Many smokers apparently furious about the situation and protest by
smoking in the border of the restricted area. I don't know any other
government department in Hong Kong making so many people's life worse.
