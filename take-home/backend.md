# Lottery system

We are building a lottery system. 

## System requirements

In this system, we are selling tickets and perform the draws continuously and periodically.

After the previous draw, contestants can start to participate in the next draw.

Our system will assign 1 ticket per contestant.

Every ticket is unique.

Every *x* seconds there will be a draw and there will be only *1* winner. 

And the system will response to contestants whether they win or not after the draw, which also means at the end of __x__ seconds.

All ticket in 1 draw will be discarded once said draw is completed.

## Technical requirements

We are using Ruby on Rails, but you can use whatever tools / language you prefer.

You must write code to validate your system, for example using JUnit, Gherkins or other testing framework of your choice.

The test suite should be as complete as possible.

Your system should be able to deploy in 1 command without using superuser privileges in the host system.

Your system must be able to accept actions from other systems.

## Logistics

Take a reasonable timeframe to complete the project. It should not take longer than 2 working days.

After completion, please send your work via Email to a zip file with a clear git history OR a link to a private repo on any git hosting services with access.

Also outline the limitation of your system and how you will improve it (if you have time).

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
