# How to work with him?

No Bullshit.

Always seek alignment and win-win.

Frank, and you can be mean to him, coz he sometimes is.

Laugh at his lame joke.

DO NOT second-guess decisions, unless there are new learnings.

Contract is an agreement. Changing it requires stakeholders acknowledgement.

He is hopelessly optimistics, sorry =P.
